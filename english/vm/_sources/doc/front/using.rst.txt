Using this manual
+++++++++++++++++

ICAM Virtual Machine (VM) is a CNC machine simulator, which is fully
integrated into ICAM’s Icam Post GENER post-processing and Control
Emulator CERUN products.

This manual is organized as follows.

-  “:ref:`overview`” provides a brief description of Virtual Machine.

   \

-  “:ref:`quest_section`” describes how to create and maintain Virtual Machine models
   using the ICAM QUEST Developer’s System. It explains how to define the
   kinematics (i.e., axes) of the CNC machine, how to flesh out the model by
   creating and/or importing machine components and enabling or disabling
   collision testing of these components, and how to customize the model using
   the ICAM macro language to support special features.

   \

-  “:ref:`vm_runtime`” describes the operation of Virtual Machine with ICAM’s
   Icam Post post-processing (GENER) and Control Emulator (CERUN) products.
   It explains the post-processor command interface that can be used with
   GENER to control the simulation. It also describes a common user
   interface used by both GENER and CERUN to view and manipulate the model
   during the simulation, as well as to define cutting tools, holding
   fixtures, finish part, rough stock, and workpiece and tool
   compensations, which are used to validate the simulation.

   \

-  “:ref:`vm_reference`” describes the input controls (keys, keyboard shortcuts
   and mouse actions), toolbar menus and menu bar selections, and macro
   customization features available with Virtual Machine.

Following these sections are:
a :ref:`glossary` of terms used in this manual;
and an :ref:`genindex`.

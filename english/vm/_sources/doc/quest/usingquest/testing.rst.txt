Testing the Model
-----------------

The Tools»Start Runtime (Ctrl F9) menu-bar selection provides a
convenient method of running GENER and CERUN against a model currently
being edited. When testing a model in this manner, it is not necessary
to save the model before starting the test. The standard GENER or CERUN
launch panel will appear. When it does, the default simulation database
will show “\ Quest – (Models in Memory)” and the model name drop-down
selection will list all of the models out for editing.

Any changes made to the model in QUEST while the test is running will
not be seen until GENER or CERUN is restarted.

Because the test feature does not require a generated model, you might
be tempted to go long periods before saving or generating. You are
cautioned to save your work periodically to minimize loss of data caused
by power outages or other serious problems.

The Tools»Test and Tools»Retest menu bar selections cannot be used to
test a model.

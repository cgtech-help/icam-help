**Section Overview**

-  The :ref:`Dialog Editor<dialog_editor>` allows you to build custom dialog
   boxes, which can be activated during processing to query the NC programmer
   for any necessary information.

   \

-  :ref:`Startup/Shutdown Macros<startup_shutdown_macros>` allow you
   to customize the actions of the model at the start and end of processing.

   \

-  :ref:`Event Macros<event_macros>` provide customization control
   at other key events in the simulation of the program.

   \

-  :ref:`User Function Macros<user_function_macros>` are used to develop your own macro
   functions that can be called by other macros in the model.

Virtual Machine uses the ICAM macro language facility
(see “:ref:`macro_language`”) to customize models.
This is the same programming facility that is used with GENER and CERUN.

   A-axis

      The axis of rotation about the X-axis.

      An acronym for “additive manufacturing”. ICAM supports additive
      material deposition on AM or hybrid AM machines.

   AppData

      An acronym for “application data”. This is a root directory (or
      folder) in which application specific data are stored. The
      application data is generally separated from installation data, so
      that user customizations are not affected when the application
      software is upgraded or uninstalled.

   APT

      (Automatically Programmed Tools) A computer language used to program
      NC machines. CAM systems almost universally generate a simplified
      variation of APT as a CLDATA file describing the NC program
      requirements.

   aptsource

      An APT-like file generated by a CAM system. Icam Post reads aptsource
      files and internally converts them to binary CLDATA.

      containing one or more models.

   environment variables

      Environment variables (also called system variables) are key
      platform variables that control software behavior. For example,
      ``icam_dbf`` defines the location of the Virtual Machine database.

      This is the quill: a linear axes located between a rotary head axis
      and the tool.

   G code

      This letter address specifies preparatory functions of the machine.
      MCD is sometimes called G-Code. See also :term:`M code`.

   GENER

      The **gener** command line executes the GENER module.

   generate function

      The generate function
      saves the model in the Virtual Machine database, in a form that can be used with GENER and CERUN.

   generated model

      Is a model that has been generated successfully.

   head

      A head refers to a removable head attachment that holds tools at some
      angle, or that extends the reach or spindle RPM of tools.

   high speed machining

      HSM implies faster than normal cutting, often requiring specialized
      controllers, machines, tooling and cutting fluids.

      to aid in the development of model macros.

   macro system variables

      Macro system variables are variables that can be accessed or set
      during a macro. These variables contain information on past, current
      and future processing.

   major word

      Traditionally major words are 2000 class records but other class
      records do exist. The major word is the first parameter (word) in the
      post-processor command. Example: SPINDL/ 350,RPM,CLW where the SPINDL
      word is the major word. See also :term:`minor word`.

      is CNC program code in the form of 8-track tapes or files.

   minor word

      Using the major word example, the minor word would consist of any
      word following the major word. Thus RPM and CLW would classify as
      minor words. See also :term:`major word`.

   modal

      A condition that remains in effect until it is changed.

   NA

      Short for “not applicable”.

   NC code

   non-generated model

      A model file that has been saved but not generated.

   nutating axis

      A rotary head or table axis, normally mounted at an angle of 45
      degrees, connected to a second rotary head or table axis. A nutating
      axis, or nutator, can orient the tool to any position within a
      hemisphere.

   offset

      An adjustment made to the tool path to compensate for tool
      dimensions.

   origin

      The origin is the location from which the coordinates are taken.
      In CNC terminology, the origin may be called program zero, work zero,
      part zero or part origin.

   point

      A position in space defined in Cartesian coordinates as (x,y,z).

   Polar coordinates

      The coordinates of a point in a plane, measured as its Cartesian
      distance from the origin and an angle from the X axis to a line
      joining the point to the origin. Polar interpolation normally uses
      the machine X axis to define the distance and the machine C axis to
      define the angle.

   post-processor command

      A post-processor command is a single major word or a major word in
      combination with minor words and numerical parameters. Example:
      SPINDL/350,RPM,CLW. The post-processor command gives specific
      motion or preparatory functions in APT.

   PSE

      PSE is an acronym for post-process / simulate / emulate. This term
      describes the unique ICAM functionality that combines Icam Post
      post-processing, Virtual Machine simulation, and Control Emulator MCD
      based verification, all within a single session.

   QUEST

      The **quest** command line executes the QUEST module.

   questionnaire function

      The questionnaire function is the module that asks for all the
      information about your machine and control necessary to operate it.

   quill

      This is the extending axes: a linear axes located between a rotary
      head axis and the tool.

   register

      A register is letter address representing functions of the
      controller.

   register format

      The register’s format is defined by a string that includes the
      register name and various formatting options. For example: ‘X4.4’
      where ‘X’ is the register name and the numeric format is 4 decimal
      positions before and after the punched decimal point.

   resolution

      A register’s resolution is the minimum numeric step of the actual
      register value to increase or decrease.

   right hand rule

      Using your right hand, point your thumb in the direction of the vector;
      your fingers curl in the direction of positive rotation.
      See also :term:`left hand rule`.

   rotary axis

      An axis producing motion of the tool with a changing tool axis.
      Typically an A, B or C-axis.

   RTCP

      Rotating Tool Center Point (RTCP) is a feature of advanced CNC
      controls, which compute rotary axis pivot offsets and linearization
      requirements in the CNC control, instead of in the post-processor.
      With RTCP, XYZ coordinate data and feed rate calculations are output
      at the tool tip and not the control point of the machine as is the
      traditional case. The most significant benefits of RTCP are the
      ability to perform tool length and diameter compensation with the
      head tilted at some angle to the machine XYZ axes. Other benefits
      include shorter and simpler programs since they do not include
      linearization steps and simpler feed rate calculations since the
      rotary component of the motion is not included in the feed
      calculation.

   STL

      Stereo lithography file; represents an object by defining its “skin” as a mesh of triangles.

   system variables

      System variables (also called environment variables) are key
      platform variables that control software behavior. For example,
      icam_dbf defines the location of the Virtual Machine database.

   tape file

      A file with the extension (.tap). This file is output after
      post-processing and it contains the MCD for a machine. Few machines
      today use 8 track paper tape, but the term “tape” is still commonly
      used to describe MCD.

   tool path

      The tool path is the given direction of the cutting tool.

   vector

      In CNC terminology, a vector is used as a qualifier of direction.
      For example: a tool may have a vector of (i,j,k) where i,j,k represents
      the direction of the tool.

   vsw file

      The verification setup file that stores Virtual Machine part-program specific settings.

   words manager

      The words manager panel can be accessed through the tools drop down
      menu in the questionnaire. It provides the user the ability to
      modify the standard ISO major and minor words list.

   work subdirectory

      The icam_appdata\\work subdirectory normally contains the
      Virtual Machine database file.

The Simulation»Measure settings only take effect while in measurement
mode, as set using the |measure_button| measurement mode button on the VM Mode
toolbar or Simulation»Mode»Measurement menu bar. Once in measurement
mode, clicking with the left-mouse button causes measurements to be
taken between the selected objects. Press the ESC key to undo
selections. Press and hold the Ctrl key to manipulate the camera with
the mouse while taking measurements.

Within VM, objects are constructed of triangles. The
Simulation»Measure menu-bar functions and matching VM Measure toolbar
provide the following measurement options.

.. container:: icon-bullet

      :height: 0.219in

   The **Distances and angles** selection measures the distance and
   angle between subsequently selected entities, as well as the *xyz*
   offset between entities.

.. container:: icon-bullet

   The **Radius and center** selection measures the radius and *xyz*
   center of a circle constructed through 3 subsequently selected points
   and/or edge midpoints.

.. container:: icon-bullet

   .. image:: ../../../media/vm_measure_vertex_button.png
      :height: 0.219in

   The **Vertex** selection enables or disables the picking of points on
   the boundary of the triangles that make up the object.

.. container:: icon-bullet

   .. image:: ../../../media/vm_measure_edge_button.png
      :height: 0.219in

   The **Edge** selection enables or disables the picking of edges of
   the triangles.

.. container:: icon-bullet

   .. image:: ../../../media/vm_measure_face_button.png
      :height: 0.219in

   The **Face** selection enables or disables the picking of faces of
   the triangles.

.. container:: icon-bullet

   .. image:: ../../../media/vm_measure_fan_button.png
      :height: 0.219in

   The **Fan** selection switches between chained (one to the next) and
   fanned (one to many) measurements. In fanned mode, the first
   selection is the primary object, which is then measured against each
   subsequent selection.

.. container:: icon-bullet

   .. image:: ../../../media/vm_measure_overlay_button.png
      :height: 0.219in

   The **Overlay** selection, when enabled, ensures that the objects
   selected for measurement will always be visible, no matter how the
   camera is oriented.

If none of the Vertex, Edge or Face selections is active, then all
objects can be selected.

The *xyz* information in the above measurements is with respect to
the frame selected in the VM Grid toolbar. Measurement information
appears in the form of a small HUD (heads-up display) in the
simulation window.

When measuring in-process stock, the Simulation»Cross Section
function can be used to section the stock for better visibility or to
obtain measurements in the cross section plane.

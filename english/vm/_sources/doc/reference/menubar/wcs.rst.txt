Simulation»Use World CS :small:`(QUEST only)`
---------------------------------------------

The Use World CS function toggles between two possible representations
of component coordinates. When selected, component coordinates are
listed in world coordinates, originating from the center of the grids.
When unselected, a component’s coordinates are listed relative to its
parent (i.e., in local coordinates). The Use World CS function can also
be toggled from the VM Construct toolbar.

The Use World CS setting also affects the placement of objects copied
from one place to another in the model navigator. When world coordinates
are selected, the object retains its position in space despite being
moved or copied from one place to another in the navigator hierarchy.
When local coordinates are selected, a copied or moved object is always
placed relative to its new parent at the same offset it was originally
at relative to its old parent.

It is also important to note that when world coordinates are selected,
objects are attached to the model based on the current model axes
settings. You might get unexpected results if the axes are not at their
default locations. You should select the *Reset All Axes* button in the
QUEST Axes window before creating, copying or moving objects.

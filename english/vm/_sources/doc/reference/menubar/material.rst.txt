Activates the Material dialog, which can be used to define standard
material visual properties. Material properties are saved by default
in a *materials.m3d* file in the application data directory. Select the
[…] button to choose an alternate materials file.

The following controls affect how material appears:

-  The **Diffuse** component is the color of the object.
-  The **Ambient** component is the color of light that indirectly
   strikes the object (for example, the color of the walls). For
   simplicity, the ambient component should be set to the same color as
   the diffuse component.
-  The **Specular** component is the color of the light given off by the
   main light source.
-  The **Shininess** slider determines how reflective the material’s
   surface is. A shiny object reflects more of the specular light
   component back to the viewer.
-  The **Transparency** slider can be used to set material properties
   for plastics and glass. Set “stock” components transparent to have an
   unobstructed view of the tool path trace.

The five material property values are assigned to each component when
it is created or modified. The material name is also saved, for
informational purposes only. Changing the properties of an existing
material will not affect the model or any stock/fixture/part objects
that have already been created. When displaying the material
properties of a component, the material name will appear as “Custom”
if the 5 properties cannot be exactly matched in the current
materials file.

Menu Bar
*********

Virtual Machine can be nearly completely controlled from the Simulation
menu bar selection.
The Simulation menu is available in QUEST when developing a model.
It is only available in the GENER and CERUN Full interface if
material Removal Simulation and/or Virtual Machine Simulation are
selected in the Simulation launch panel settings.

The following items are available, listed as they appear in the Simulation menu:

   .. toctree::

      main
      controller
      manager

Activates the Simulation Compare dialog, which defines
various settings used when comparing the in-process stock against
the related part. This function is only available with a Material
Removal Simulation (MRS) license.

The association between a part and its corresponding in-process stock
is defined in the :ref:`Simulation»Parts/Fixtures dialog<sim_partfixture>`.

The comparison colorization settings are applied only to gouge and
excess material, which must first be enabled by selecting one or both
of the :ref:`Boolean Overcut<sim_filter_boolean_overcut>` and
:ref:`Boolean Undercut<sim_filter_boolean_undercut>` filters.

The comparison is done by sampling the surface of the gouge and/or
excess material and computing the shortest distance to the part. The
distance is then used to assign a fixed or graduated color, as defined
using the various options of the Compare dialog. If the sample size is
small, or the part very large, the colorization process may take a long
time to compute. The comparison can be cancelled at any time, in which
case the displayed results will be incomplete (but perhaps still
useful).

The settings of note on the Compare dialog are:

-  **Units**: Specifies the units of measure for all numeric values in
   the dialog.

-  **Sampling steps**: Specifies the maximum distance along the surface
   between comparison measurements. Using a small value may greatly
   increase the computation time and complexity of the resulting
   colorized object.

-  **Scale style**: Defines how the excess and gouge distances will be
   colorized. Three excess and three gouge zones are available, at
   increasing offsets from the part. With the Solid color and Gradient
   color settings, each zone is represented by a single user definable
   color (using the color buttons to the right of the scale). With the
   Gradient zone setting, the inner two zones can individually be color
   graduated between two colors.

-  **Track measurement…**: If selected, the measured distance between
   stock and part under the cursor will be shown and dynamically updated
   as the cursor moves. You can also toggle this feature on and off
   using Ctrl Q.

Those surfaces on the colorized in-process stock that are neither
gouged or excess will not be shown, unless the
:ref:`Simulation»Show»Filters»Transparent Zero filter<sim_filter_transparent_zero>`
is enabled.

Macro Functions
***************

This section lists the macro functions available for use in Virtual Machine (VM) model macros.
VM functions are easily identified by a three letter $FMS prefix.
VM functions can be called in post-processor and control emulator macros;
however, diagnostics may be generated if a model is not being used.
Functions are organized in groups.

The first section summarizes the functions by category.

**Syntax Format Conventions**

The syntax for macro functions is listed using the following format conventions:

-  Square brackets :math:`\big[ \; \big]` encase syntax that is optional.
   The :small:`0:n` symbol preceding the bracketed item,
   as in :math:`\icamrange{0.8}{0}\,\big[,a\,\big]`
   indicates that the bracketed item *a* can be repeated zero or more times.

   \

-  Parentheses :math:`\big( \; \big)` encase syntax that lists a number of choices,
   one of which is required. The parentheses are omitted when the syntax is a
   simple choice among a number of keywords.
   The :small:`1:n` symbol preceding the parenthesized item,
   as in :math:`\icamrange{0.8}{1}\,\big(,a\,\big)`
   indicates that the item *a* can be repeated one or more times.

   \

-  Any value not contained in square brackets or parentheses must be
   programmed each time the function is used.

   \

-  Formal keywords are shown in bold upper case, as in **ON** and
   **AUTO**.

   \

-  Italicized lower case words identify requirements for numeric or
   string values, as in *offset* or *value*.

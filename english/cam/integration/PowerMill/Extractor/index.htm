            <h3>ICAM Manufacture Extractor</h3>
            <img src="../../../images/extractor_main.jpg"><br />
            <h4>Manufacturing Settings</h4>
            <p>
                This section is the main section of the Extractor. It allows you to control some of the manufacturing settings for the simulation.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the top, you have the ICAM specific settings used to define your post processor, control emulator, and virtual machine. If there are multiple products, you can right-click 
                the category and select one from the list. <br>
                You can also change the CL file or the NC file.
            </p>
            <p>The following section contains all the extracted information from your CAM system such as your part, stock, fixture, and tools.</p>
            <p>
                Each manufacturing process is considered one program, each with their associated elements.<br><br>
                The coordinate system axis is used to position your stock, part and fixture inside ICAM's virtal machine. It is known as the <b>stock axis</b>. If you require an additional offset,
                you can edit the values between the parenthesis.
                <h5>Product Root</h5>
                Below the stock axis, you can find the product root consisting of all extracted geometry. The exactror organizes them between 3 groups: <b>part</b>, <b>stock</b>, and <b>fixture</b>.<br/>
                You can right-click on each node to assign them to the different types.
                Note that the extractor can automatically recognize preset geometry.<br>
                A special <b>None</b> type can be used to ignore certain geometries when extracting the information to Virtual Machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below the product root, you can find all the tools extracted from your ICAM system. Only the used tools will show a checkmark. The unused tools can be found hidden under an expandable
                button.<br><br>
                Finally, there's information about all the work offset available. The values shown in the bracket are relative to the stock axis value, any additional offset, and the settings from the 
                machine attributes.
            </p>
            <h4>Machine Attributes</h4>
            <p>This section is used to set the tolerances. The tolerance settings are an important part for proper simulation. 
                The tolerance settings can be separated into 2 distinct categories: VM tolerances and STL tolerances.
                The values are based off the unit system shown at the bottom right corner of the extractor.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <b>gouge</b> tolerance represents the amount of collision authorized between the tools and finished part.</li>
                <li>The <b>collision</b> tolerance is related to the collisions with the environment elements such as your fixtures. By default, this value can be relatively large,
                understanding that the machine elements usually have safety zones defined.</li>
                <li>The <b>facet</b> tolerance defines the tessallation used in revolution solids calculation such as a rotating spindle. It is also used for the tool shape tolerance 
                    relative to the analytical definition.</li>
                <li>The <b>resolution</b> tolerance controls the tool path resolution.</li>
                <li>The <b>part</b>, <b>stock</b>, and <b>fixture</b> tolerance defines the tessallation for each of the different geometries.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Finally, you can use the button to <b>set as default</b> values if you have made changes.</p>
            <p>The <b>Machine base offset</b> and <b>Base offset as #Base</b> are used by the software to calculate the work offset value when importing the CAM elements inside 
            virtual machine.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Case 1: <b>If none of the boxes are checked</b>, then the value of the virtual machine work offset will not take account the diffence between the tool axis and stock axis.
                This will <b>not</b> affect the intertal work offset value.<br> <b>Fixture compensation = CAM fixture compensation</b></li>
                <li>Case 2: <b>If Machine base offset is checked alone</b>, then the value of the virtual machine work offset will take account the difference between the tool and stock axis.
                This will affect the internal work offset value.<br> <b>Fixture compensation = CAM fixture compensation + base offset</b></li>
                <li>Case 3: <b>If Machine base offset and Base offset as #Base is checked </b>, then the value of the virtual machine work offset will take account the difference between the tool and stock axis.
                This will <b>not</b> affect the internal work offset value. It will add the difference to a #Base offset instead. <br><b>
                Fixture compensation = CAM fixture compensation<br> Simulation fixture compensation #BASE = base offset</b></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Working Folder</h4>
            <p>At the bottom, you can choose a folder to save all the extracted elements and information.</p>
            <h4>Output Settings</h4>
            <p>Under the machine attributes, there are more settings that controls the output settings.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Copy CL source</b> will set the extractor to copy over the CL or NC source file to your working folder.</li>
                <li><b>Simulat by Program</b> is used when multiple manufacturing operations exists within the same process. You can split them into their own
                simulation to simulate them individually or simulate them sequentially.</li>
                <li><b>Use CAM Folder</b> forces the working folder to be the same as the CL File location.</li>
                <li><b>Regenerate STL</b> is used to regenerate the STL files of the generated geometries.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Mode</h4>
            <p>Under the Mode tab, you have the option to run the different ICAM products with or without simulation. Similarly, you can choose to enable material removal (MRS) or not.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>GENER</b> is for post processing.</li>
                <li><b>CERUN</b> is for G-code processing.</li>
                <li><b>PSE</b> is for both post and G-code processing.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Preference options</h4>
            <p>
                More options are available under the preference options window. To access this window, you must right-click the extractor top bar, using the selection window, go to 
                <b>preference options</b>.
            </p>
            <img src="../../../images/extractor_prefopt.jpg"><br />
            <p>This window provide additional options which are either generic or specific to a CAM system, shown in bracket.</p>
            <h5>General Settings</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Using default tool library</b> is used when an external tool library use is preferred. This library have tools that differ from the exported tools from the CAM
                system.</li>
                <li><b>Run GENER/CERUN with launch panel</b> is used when you want to have the ICAM launch UI appear. This will allow you to make some final changes to post processing
                or G-code emulation.</li>
                <li><b>Save/Restore last settings</b> is used to save all your Extractor setting for the current job. Such that, if you close the Extractor, you will be able to reopen
                it with all the same changes you have made.</li>
                <li><b>Extract unused tools</b> is used to extract any tools that are not used, but were created in the CAM system.</li>
                <li><b>Include hidden geometries</b> is used to extract any geometries that are hidden in the CAM.</li>
                <li><b>Backup simulation job</b> is used to create an additional job file as backup.</li>
                <li><b>Simplify tool profile</b> is used to recalculate the tool profile to keep the minimum number of line segments based on the current facet tolerance.</li>
                <li><b>Using turning tool setup angle</b> is used to set the default turning tool angle based on the tooling information.</li>
                <li><b>Force length comp values to be 0s for VM tools</b> is used to force a value of 0 for any length compensation value inside Virtual Machine.</li>
                <li><b>Force diameter com values to be 0s for VM tools</b> is used to force a value of 0 for any diameter compensation value inside Virtual Machine.</li>
                <li><b>Force offset number to be 1 for VM tools</b> is used when you need to have your length and diameter offset numbers to be 1.</li>
                <li><b>Enable frame retrieving</b> is used to retrieve the coordinate system embeded in the product, and to set it as a FRAME (coordinate system) in Virtual Machine.
                It's name must containt the <b>Frame filter</b> string.</li>
                <li><b>Minimum tool body offset:</b> is used to offset the body of a parametric tool. A <b>positive</b> offset reduces the diameter of the tool body.</li>
                <li><b>Geometry output format</b> is used to change the file format of the extracted geometry. An additional option allows you to merge non-machinable fixtures to be
                 a single object.</li>
                <li><b>Default CL source extension:</b> is used to tell the extractor what is the default CL or NC source extension.</li>

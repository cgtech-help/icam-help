<li><p>During a Windows Floating License Server installation, you will be
given the choice of port number to use. The default, port 6667,
matches the fixed port used in previous versions of the license
server.</p></li>
<li><p>When installing other products on Windows client machines in a
floating license network, you can now specify the port number to use
when communicating with the server.</p></li>
<li><p>The Windows ICAMID Utility now allows you to select the port number
when testing for a connection with the license server.</p></li>
<li><p>The UNIX floating license server now accepts a –p <em>port</em> command line

<h3>Licensing<a class="headerlink" href="#licensing" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The license server is now at release 090. The primary difference
between this latest release and the earlier 080 release is the
support for a user specified port number. The port number can be
specified during installation and changed after installation using
the Floating License Manager (from the server computer).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>On client systems, the server port number can now be specified in the
icam.key file, by appending the port number to the server name or IP
address. For example:</p>
<p>000 192.168.1.106:6670</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>New license options are available for SmartPATH, SmartCUT and
SmartFEED modules. These are described starting on page 11.</p></li>
<li><p>The Windows Floating License Manager behaves differently depending on
whether it is run from an ICAM Productivity Tools client
installation, or from an ICAM Floating License Server installation.</p></li>
<li><p>When run from a client installation, the Setup menu provides a
“Remote Server…” function to locate the floating license server on
your network and optionally update the client icam.key file to point
to the server.</p></li>
<li><p>When run from a server installation, there are additional and
extended Setup menu options that let you choose the key file, the
lost license timeout period, icamlm.log file contents and server
port.</p></li>

<div class="line">The General Description / General Information section question #3
supports a new</div>
<div class="line">“<strong>Robotics</strong>” choice, available to those with CAM-POST
Complete “p5” license. This first release of robotics is geared
towards drilling, milling and trimming operations using standard
CAM manufacturing programs.</div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image2.bmp"><img alt="image2" src="../../_images/image2.bmp" style="width: 2.49028in; height: 2.50903in;" /></a>The Machine Description / Rotary Axes section includes a
new “<strong>DH params</strong>” tab where you define the 6 rotary joints of
the robot. An [Import] button allows the rotary joint information to
be imported from an existing Virtual Machine model. Alternately, the
joint information can input by hand, and later a model can be created
from the robot post-processor (via the “File»New»Model»
FromExistingPost” menu function).</p></li>
<li><p>The Control Description / Advanced 5D Machining section “RTCP”
questions must be answered, since the control of the robot is
restricted in this first release to virtual axes only.</p></li>
<li><p>The installation Samples folder contains post-processors and
associated models for both a <strong>Puma</strong> and a <strong>Kuka</strong> robot.</p></li>
<li><p>A new question in the General Description / General Information
section controls how <strong>merging lathe</strong> CLDATA commands are
post-processed when both turrets are active. The choice of method
should not have an impact on the generated NC code but it will affect
how the code appears in the Gener listing, and it may affect macro
processing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image3.bmp"><img alt="image3" src="../../_images/image3.bmp" style="width: 5.06in; height: 0.86in;" /></a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The “Time” method is the default, and causes processing to switch (as
it always has) from one turret to the other based on the predicted
machining time for each turret. Generated NC code will be produced in
approximately the same order as the NC code will be processed at the
machine.</p></li>
<li><p>The new “Sequential” method causes all CLDATA for the first turret to
be post-processed up to the next synchronization mark, followed by
all CLDATA for the second turret. For some this may be a preferred
way of viewing the listing, and it may simplify macro processing.</p></li>
<li><p>The Control Description / Linear Interpolation section has a series
of new questions dealing with support for a “<strong>skip code</strong>”, used
by the machine in probing operations to detect a touch. When used in
a post-processor in combination with Virtual Machine, the skip-code
function can be used to simulate probing and part transfer
operations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image4.bmp"><img alt="image4" src="../../_images/image4.bmp" style="width: 5.05in; height: 2.34in;" /></a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The Automatic Canned Cycles / General Drill Cycle Information section
question #24.1 “Incremental secondary plane reference” now includes a
new “±R” option in support of the <strong>Acramatic 950</strong> cycle return W
register. Answer “+R” to define the secondary clearance as being
relative to the primary clearance, in a normal positive direction.</p></li>
<li><p>The Optional Post-processor Words / BREAK Command section has a new
question #5.1 “Generate RETRCT with <strong>feed break</strong>” that can
disable the automatic RETRCT to clearance plane (CLEARP or CLRSRF)
that occurs when breaking a program on a feed motion.</p></li>
<li><p>The Optional Post-processor Words / CALSUB Command section has been
revised as follows:</p></li>
<li><p>A subprogram repeat range now supports NC program labels for the
start and end of the range of repeated NC code (prior to this
release, the range could only be identified by N blocks). Labels
allow the <strong>Siemens REPEAT</strong> and <strong>Heidenhain CALL LBL</strong> commands to
be supported.</p></li>
<li><p>It is now possible to define both repeat range and subprogram call
functionality in the same post-processor (e.g., Heidenhain CALL LBL
and CALL PGM). New DEFSUB post-processor command syntax is available
to define the preferred type to use in the NC code for any given
subprogram definition in the CLDATA.</p></li>
<li><p>More control is available over the placement of subprograms and the
timing of when they are output to tape.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The placement is controlled by question #4 “Subprogram output location”
with choices being to output the subprogram in the same file as the main
program NC code; or to output all subprograms together in a separate
file; or to output each subprogram in its own file.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image5.bmp"><img alt="image5" src="../../_images/image5.bmp" style="width: 5.05in; height: 3.78in;" /></a></p>
<p>The timing of output is controlled by question #4.1 “Subprogram output
processing” with choices being to output the subprogram when it is
defined (i.e., DEFSUB), or when first called (CALSUB), or at the end of
processing (FINI).</p>
<p>When deferring a subprogram’s output to the end of processing, a new
question #4.2 “Use first call context” can be answered “Yes” to have the
post-processor set itself to the machine status that was in effect when
the subprogram was first called, before post-processing the subprogram
for output to NC tape.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A new question #5 “<strong>INDEX &amp; COPY processing</strong>” determines how
the post-pro­cessor handles INDEX and COPY commands that were not
processed by the CAM system (i.e., that are present in the CLDATA).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The INDEX &amp; COPY choices depend on the types of subprograms that are
available, or not, and include:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p><em>Choice</em></p></th>

</table>
<p>The APT standard COPY command can define a transformation of the copied
code. CAM-POST can support some types of transformations, using a local
coordinate system (LCS) and/or incremental positioning. This can be
controlled using the new DEFSUB/INDEX command, described on page 9.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Two new Post-processor Customization macros are available with this
release:</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image6.bmp"><img alt="image6" src="../../_images/image6.bmp" style="width: 2.28958in; height: 2.65972in;" /></a>A new <strong>Declaration Macro</strong> provides a standard place for
GLOBAL, OBJECT and FUNCTN macro declarations. This macro was added as
part of an effort to help developers create more stable macro code as
well as catch misspellings and improper use of variables. More
information about the declaration macro can be found on page 28.</p></li>
<li><p>A new <strong>Register Macro</strong> provides detailed control over the
formatting of registers. This macro was added to provide a more
targeted approach to NC tape editing than can be achieved by using
either the Tape Macro or Tape Editor. More information about the
register macro can be found on page 31.</p></li>
<li><p>The Build Tab now highlights errors in <strong>red</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The first line of the Diffs Tab, which identifies the objects being
compared, now always stays visible, even when scrolling.</p></li>

<h3>Gener Run-Time<a class="headerlink" href="#gener-run-time" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The Gener launch panel has been redesigned for V21.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image7.bmp"><img alt="image7" src="../../_images/image7.bmp" style="width: 5.12in; height: 3.3in;" /></a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The new <strong>unified launch panel</strong> combines the activation of Gener
post-processing, CeRun control emulation and Virtual Machine
simulation all in a single interface. This was done in support of a
new V21 PSE (<em>Post/Simulation/Emulation</em>) enhancement that allows
Gener and CeRun to be run in parallel (so that CeRun simulates NC
code as it is being created by Gener) or in series (so that CeRun
begins simulation immediately after Gener completes post-processing).
This new feature is described on page 25.</p></li>
<li><p>There is now a distinct panel for Virtual Machine simulation, which
clearly indicates if simulation is enabled or not, and if enabled
whether any information is missing. There are similar distinct panels
for Gener and CeRun. A new Preferences panel groups various
user-preference choices together for easy access.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a new “<strong>Save for review</strong>” preference, which if
selected will cause Gener and CeRun to save their results at the end
of processing so that you can later review the program using the Full
interface.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image8.bmp"><img alt="image8" src="../../_images/image8.bmp" style="width: 4.92in; height: 1.58in;" /></a></p>
<p>Results are saved at the end of processing into a file having the same
name as the listing, but with a file type of ZRJ. To review an NC
program’s results, drag and drop the ZRJ file onto the launch panel or
desktop icon (or open the results using the [Job] button), then press
OK. The Full interface will be activated showing the results at the end
of Gener or CeRun processing. These include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Input, Output (Gener only) and Console window complete traces</p></li>
<li><p>Source window listing the input file</p></li>
<li><p>Diagnostic window listing all diagnostics</p></li>
<li><p>Virtual Machine simulation window</p></li>
<li><p>Controller window including TimeLine access to entire program</p></li>
<li><p>Material removal simulation in-process stock final state</p></li>
<li><p>View Listing and View NC code menu selections</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The save-for-review function allows, for example, a program to be run in
background mode and then later opened for more detailed review if
necessary. The ZRJ file contains sufficient information to allow a
program to be rewound and reprocessed if desired (although this is not
recommended for production programs).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>There have been a number of other changes to the launch to make
settings more visible and/or easier to modify:</p></li>
<li><p>The run-time interface (i.e., Full, Progress, Minimized, Background)
is now selected from a drop-down list at the top, instead of the old
2-part selection.</p></li>
<li><p>The selected CAM system is now clearly listed in the Gener panel.</p></li>
<li><p>The launch panel now clearly shows the full path and filename of the
definitions file being used (in earlier releases this information was
available in the CAM panel, but the path was not shown).</p></li>
<li><p>The [Help] button has been removed, but the F1 function key still
brings up more detailed help, and tooltips are available for all
input fields.</p></li>
<li><p>The Gener Full Interface has a new <strong>File»SaveForReview</strong> function
that will save the current state of post-processing into a ZRJ file
for later review. Explicitly saving the process inhibits the
automatic save that normally occurs at the end of processing when the
“save for review” launch panel preference is selected.</p></li>
<li><p>CAM-POST now supports <strong>merging milling operations</strong> on mill-turn
machines. This means that APPLY/MILL commands are now valid within a
HEAD/BOTH – HEAD/OFF block. This is especially useful for CAM systems
such as CATIA, which output all aptsource for the upper turret,
followed by all aptsource for the lower turret.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If Gener detects invalid merging, such as simultaneous milling and
turning on the same workpiece, then it will output a diagnostic, but
allow processing to continue.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The BREAK command now only retracts when <strong>breaking on a feed
motion</strong> if a CLEARP or CLRSRF is in effect and the new BREAK section
question #5.1 “Generate RETRCT with feed break” is answered in the
affirmative. The BREAK command also treats high feed positioning
motions (as defined using PPFUN/24) in the same way as RAPID motions
when looking for suitable break point.</p></li>
<li><p>The following new commands and command options are available:</p></li>
<li><p>The post-processor now supports <strong>INDEX</strong> and <strong>COPY</strong> commands.
Normally the post-processor does not see these commands, which are
actually CAM system instructions, with INDEX commands identifying
regions of code to be copied, and COPY commands causing the CLDATA to
be repeated or repeatedly transformed a number of times.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image9.png"><img alt="image9" src="../../_images/image9.png" style="height: 30px;" /></a></p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image10.png"><img alt="image10" src="../../_images/image10.png" style="height: 210px;" /></a></p>
<p>The post-processor can process INDEX and COPY in the same way as the CAM
system would, or it can ignore these commands (with a diagnostic) as it
has in past releases, or it can even use subprograms and/or repeat
ranges to generate the required copies and transformations. These
choices are controlled by the following new <strong>DEFSUB</strong> command:</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image11.png"><img alt="image11" src="../../_images/image11.png" style="height: 210px;" /></a></p>
<p>TYPE,OFF inhibits INDEX and COPY processing; ON uses whatever choice was
selected by the post-processor author in the CALSUB section questions;
and the remaining choices select how the copy will be generated.</p>
<p>TRFORM,INCR outputs the INDEX block code in incremental so that COPY
transformation can be done by prepositioning prior to each subprogram
call; LCS outputs the INDEX block as-is, but outputs an LCS (local
coordinate system) instruction prior to each subprogram call; and OFF
outputs all codes “as-is” and assumes that the post-processor author has
handled the transformation requirements.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>CALSUB</strong> and <strong>DEFSUB</strong> commands have been enhanced to
optionally support the couplet form of parameter definition as
promoted by the ISO 4343 International Standard, with the use of ID
before the subprogram identification and TYPE before the subprogram
type.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image12.png"><img alt="image12" src="../../_images/image12.png" style="height: 150px;" /></a></p>
<p>The RANGE and CNC options are new for this release. RANGE selects the
repeat range method; CNC selects the subprogram method. CLDATA will
select whichever method is available on the machine or will select
subprograms if both methods are available. Other options have not
changed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>LINTOL</strong> command has a new option that affects how intermediate
points are calculated along the motion being linearized.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image13.png"><img alt="image13" src="../../_images/image13.png" style="height: 60px;" /></a></p>
<p>In prior releases of CAM-POST, the linearized intermediate step
distances would tend to decrease as the motion was subdivided, resulting
in potentially very small subdivisions at the end of very large rotary
moves. The linearization logic has been enhanced to eliminate the bias
that was causing step sizes to progressively decrease, which has
resulted in smoother stepping.</p>
<p>ON selects the new methodology, which is the default for V21. OFF
selects the old behaviour, and is provided for compatibility purposes
only. This new command is also available in V20-1350 and later releases,
although OFF is the default for V20.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>MODE</strong> command has a new option to control the output of probe
“skip” codes during linear interpolation motions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image14.png"><img alt="image14" src="../../_images/image14.png" style="height: 90px;" /></a></p>
<p>Skip codes are generally hidden in subprograms purchased from probe
vendors, but there may be occasions where skip codes must be generated
by the post-processor.</p>
<p>ON causes skip codes to be output with subsequent feed motions until
cancelled by OFF; NEXT outputs a skip code with the next motion only.
The optional PART,IN and OUT control the generation of alarm behaviour
codes, either resulting in an alarm at the machine if a skip is not
triggered (IN) or an alarm if a skip is triggered (OUT).</p>
<p>When Gener is running with Virtual Machine simulation, skip code
processing will be simulated provided that a probe object has been
defined and is active (which is easily done using Virtual Machine
probing functions).</p>
</section>
<section id="smartpath">
<h3>SmartPATH<a class="headerlink" href="#smartpath" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The SmartPATH licensed feature (<em>sph210</em>) was first introduced in
V20. It automatically optimizes RAPID and high-feed positioning
motions generated by the CAM system. SmartPATH works in conjunction
with Virtual Machine to replace CAM generated positioning motions
with time minimized, collision free positioning motions, based on the
machine tool kinematics (e.g., head-head, table-table…), while
respecting physical travel limitations and axes maximum positioning
rates.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>SmartPATH has been continually enhanced since it was first released.
Many of these enhancements provide for additional safe clearances and
were introduced to alleviate CNC operator concerns as well as to account
for possible slight variations in positioning tool paths at the machine.</p>
<p>These enhancements (some available under V20) include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Recognition of the machine reference position(s) stored in the
machine model so that motions to and from tool change and home
positions can be accurately computed to avoid collisions. This
feature is enabled or disabled as follows:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image15.png"><img alt="image15" src="../../_images/image15.png" style="height: 60px;" /></a></p>
<p>Additional safety clearances may be desired when moving between the
machine reference frame (e.g., tool change position) and the workpiece
or vice versa. A safe clearance distance can be optionally activated
around the tool as well as around a group of components that have been
predefined and named in the model.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image16.png"><img alt="image16" src="../../_images/image16.png" style="height: 90px;" /></a></p>
<p>By default the motion between machine reference and workpiece frames
takes full advantage of the available travel of all axes of the machine.
The following command defines a preferred region to use when moving
between machine and workpiece frames.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The ability to apply post-processor SAFETY command motion splitting
preferences to positioning motions generated by SmartPATH. This
ensures that SmartPATH generated positioning motions follow approved
shop practice where required.</p></li>
<li><p>The ability to automatically move clear of the part (e.g., pocket
wall) at feed when leaving a cut so as to avoid dwell marks. And
conversely, the ability to automatically position clear of a wall and
engage at feed when entering a cut. This was first introduced in
V20-1328.</p></li>
<li><p>The ability to control the velocity – either RAPID or high feed – of
SmartPATH generated positioning motions. By default SmartPATH uses
RAPID positioning when replacing CAM generated RAPID positioning
motions, or uses high feed positioning if the CAM generated
positioning path includes one or more high feed moves. This default
can be overridden to force all RAPID, all high-feed, or the original
behavior, using the following command:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image18.png"><img alt="image18" src="../../_images/image18.png" style="height: 150px;" /></a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The ability to control the velocity – either programmed feed or high
feed – of SmartPATH generated final approach, initial exit and wall
clearance motions. These adjusted feeds are extensions of the SMARTP
command syntax that defines the required clearance motion lengths.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image19.png"><img alt="image19" src="../../_images/image19.png" style="height: 150px;" /></a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The ability to automatically reduce safety distances where no
possible solution can be found that respects the requested safety
distances. In V20, if a solution could not be found, then SmartPATH
would diagnose the problem and then retry without any safety distance
at all. With V21, SmartPATH will diagnose the problem as before, but
will also continue to look for a solution using progressively smaller
clearance distances.</p></li>
<li><p>SmartPATH algorithms are continuously being improved, to provide more
optimal results, all while reducing CPU computation time.</p></li>

<h3>SmartCUT<a class="headerlink" href="#smartcut" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The SmartCUT licensed feature (<em>sct210</em>) is new for V21. It uses
material removal simulation to detect when the tool is not engaged
with the material (i.e., is not cutting) while at the same time being
programmed to move at a cutting feed. Where feasible SmartCUT will
change these time wasting motions to RAPID or high-feed. This is
commonly called an “Air-Cut” optimization, hence the name SmartCUT.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>SmartCUT goes one step further, by detecting RAPID or high-feed motions
that cut into the in-process stock and (in addition to warning the NC
programmer) will automatically reduce the feed rate to the upcoming
programmed feed to avoid tool breakage. Similarly, when leaving the
material, SmartCUT will detect RAPID motions that cut the stock when
leaving the part, and will automatically slow down these cutting motions
to the last programmed feed.</p>
<p>SmartCUT is activated using the following command.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image20.png"><img alt="image20" src="../../_images/image20.png" style="height: 60px;" /></a></p>
<p>SmartCUT can use either high feed or rapid positioning when replacing
air-cutting motions with positioning ones.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image21.png"><img alt="image21" src="../../_images/image21.png" style="height: 150px;" /></a></p>
<p>SmartCUT provides other settings that can: ignore air-cutting paths less
than a specified length; enforce a minimum safe distance on air-cut
positioning motions; and define minimum safe positioning approach and
exit feed distances.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>SmartCUT and SmartPATH when used together can significantly improve
NC programs containing time wasting air cuts. SmartCUT will detect
the start point and subsequent end points of air-cut segments as
normal, but instead of increasing the velocity along the programmed
path will instead use SmartPATH to compute the fastest path to the
start of the next cut. SmartPATH takes into account the current state
of the in-process stock as well as part, fixtures and machine
components, when computing the shortest path to the start of cut.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="smartfeed">
<h3>SmartFEED<a class="headerlink" href="#smartfeed" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The SmartFEED licensed feature (<em>sfd210</em>) is new for V21. It uses
material removal simulation to automatically recalculate the best
machining feed rate based on the machine tool capabilities, tool
reference cuts, and the real-time engagement of the cutting tool in
the in-process stock material.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>SmartFEED can be entirely controlled from post-processor commands, but
also includes post-processor run-time dialogs for those who prefer a
more interactive approach. SmartFEED is activated using the following
command.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image22.png"><img alt="image22" src="../../_images/image22.png" style="height: 60px;" /></a></p>
<p>SmartFEED relies on reference cut information to perform material
removal rate (MRR) based feed optimization. A reference cut defines,
among other things, the depth, width feed and speed of a successful cut,
which the software then uses to determine the feed and optionally speed
to use for the feed motions present in the NC program.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image23.png"><img alt="image23" src="../../_images/image23.png" style="height: 30px;" /></a></p>
<p>SmartFEED permits limitations to be placed on the spindle speed, feed
rate and spindle power.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image24.png"><img alt="image24" src="../../_images/image24.png" style="height: 210px;" /></a></p>
<p>SmartFEED provides other settings that can: impose limits on the growth
of the program due to the generation of additional feed motions; define
what constitutes a significant change in feed rate; define the material
removal sampling rate (precision vs. CPU balance), and more.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Models created or modified under V21 must now be <strong>Generated</strong> in
order for them to be used with CAM-POST or Control Emulator. Models
only had to be Saved in earlier releases, but V21 has introduced a
new strong data typing feature of the macro processor that must be
checked when generating a production-ready version of the model.</p></li>
<li><p>After saving or generating a model, the <strong>model descriptor</strong> will
show the list of controllable axes as selected in the
Machine Properties dialog Axis Mapping tab, listed in the order they
are attached in the model. The model descriptor can be seen in the
Database view, as well as in the Model Properties dialog Options tab.
This feature was first introduced in V20-1321.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a new “<strong>head light</strong>” lighting control for V21. The
head light control defines a light source that is directly behind the
camera and is directed into the scene. This optional light source
makes it easier to view the workpiece or machine from the rear of the
model – areas of the simulation environment where typical light
placement doesn’t reach. As with all other lights, you can control
the intensity and colour of the head light.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It is now possible to import multiple STL files in a single
operation. First select a node in the model navigator tree, then
select <strong>Simulation»Construct Entity»Import</strong> and finally, choose all
of the STL files to be imported at that node. STL import now also
recognizes and supports files containing multiple bodies. These
features were first introduced in V20-1405.</p></li>
<li><p>A new <strong>Rename branch</strong> RMB (right-mouse button) context menu
function is now available in the model navigator, which recursively
and consistently renames all entities in the selected branch. All
entities and sub-entities matching a wildcard specification are
renamed to a user-specified target name that can contain an

number of enhancements, as listed below. With the exception of the
cross section and tool path display features, all of these
enhancements are also available with Quest during model development.</p></li>
<li><p>Virtual Machine now supports <strong>3D mouse</strong> devices from 3dconnexion,
including the SpaceExplorer, SpaceNavigator, SpacePilot and
SpaceMouse.</p></li>
<li><p>Virtual Machine has its own unique ways of manipulating objects on
the screen using a combination of keyboard keys, mouse buttons and
mouse movements, which are different from those used by the CAM
system. Recognizing that this can be a source of confusion, Virtual
Machine has now been enhanced to mimic the basic object manipulation
features of CATIA, Mastercam and NX. The <strong>mouse “scheme”</strong> is
selected from the Simulation»Options dialog Misc tab in Quest, Gener
or CeRun.</p></li>

<p>Basic supported functionality includes the keyboard and mouse inputs
required to rotate, pan and zoom the window as well as to select
objects. All other keyboard and mouse functions continue to follow the
original ICAM scheme.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Two <strong>new measurement</strong> capabilities have been added.</p></li>
<li><p>It is now possible to select Kinematic objects when measuring. For
example, the spindle control point, stock mount point, linear and
rotary axes can be selected as a target point or edge and then
measured against other objects in the window.</p></li>
<li><p>The radius and center of a hole, boss or corner can now be measured
by selecting any combination of 3 points or edges – the midpoint of
the edge is used – along the circumference of the arc.</p></li>

<p>Radius and center measurements are enabled by selecting the circled
button in the VM Measure toolbar, as shown above.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A new <strong>cross section feature</strong> is available to section the
in-process stock for better visibility and measurement purposes.
Cross sectioning is controlled from the Simulation»Show»Cross Section
menu as well as from the new VM Cross Section toolbar.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image29.bmp"><img alt="image29" src="../../_images/image29.bmp" style="width: 2.43in; height: 0.44in;" /></a></p>
<p>The four leftmost buttons define where the section plane will occur,
either along a standard datum with respect to the stock mount point, or
along a custom plane chosen using the same functionality as for
measurements. The sectioning function hides in-process stock on one side
of the section plane; the <a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image30.png"><img alt="image30" src="../../_images/image30.png" style="width: 0.19905in; height: 0.19in;" /></a> Invert Plane button switches the

display on the section plane. The two rightmost buttons and the numeric
input field can be used to offset the section plane from the one
initially selected.</p>
<p>Cross sectioning does not affect the in-process stock; it only affects
the visibility of the stock. Collisions and material removal functions
will continue to operate as normal, even when the stock is sectioned.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>tool-path display</strong> has enhanced to:</p></li>
<li><p>show the tool axis vector,</p></li>
<li><p>show the last “<em>n</em>” tools or operations, and</p></li>
<li><p>permit the customization of tool path line style, width and color.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The new VM Tool-Path toolbar has controls to choose between a tool-path
trace limited by time, tools or operations. The toolbar also has a
button to enable/disable the display of tool-axis vectors.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image32.bmp"><img alt="image32" src="../../_images/image32.bmp" style="width: 1.77in; height: 0.44in;" /></a></p>
<p>The Simulation»Options dialog Tool Path tab has the same controls as
above, plus new color and style controls for different types of motions.
In particular, tool paths modified by SmartPATH, SmartCUT and SmartFEED
can be identified by style, width or color, so that the effects of these
optimization features are more readily apparent.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The VM Mode toolbar has two new buttons (shown circled below) that
can be used to temporarily inhibit material removal simulation (MRS)
and tool vs. part gouge detection.</p></li>
</ul>

is active, the in-process stock and machinable fixtures will not be
affected by the cutting action of the tool. Temporarily inhibiting MRS
can be useful to ignore further invalid cutting actions of a tool,
during the early simulation phase of a manufacturing program. Also, when
used with Run»Restart a program can be quickly run once without MRS, and
if necessary a second time with MRS following the restart, without
having to change the “Enable Material Removal Simulation” setting in the
launch panel VM pane.</p>

active, interference (i.e., collisions) will no longer be diagnosed
between the cutting tool and the design part. Temporarily inhibiting
tool/part collisions can be useful to speed up scribing or engraving
operations, if the part design does not include the image being scribed
or engraved.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Virtual Machine has a new <strong>Simulation Manager</strong> window, which lists
all of the components included in the simulation (i.e., tools, stock,
part and fixtures) and where they are attached to the model. For
example, tools will be shown attached to tool pockets, fixtures and
workpiece will be shown attached to stock mount points.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image36.bmp"><img alt="image36" src="../../_images/image36.bmp" style="width: 3.42in; height: 2.67in;" /></a>Double-clicking on a component or group header will activate
a dialog that permits modification of the selected component. As well,
pressing the RMB (right mouse button) on any component or group header
will list the actions that are available with the selected entry.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The Simulation Manager supports the concept of <strong>multiple setups</strong>.
The initial configuration is “Setup 01”. Additional setup
configurations can be created, either by copying and editing a
similar configuration, or by creating one from scratch. The
Simulation Manager supports drag &amp; drop, to allow components to be
easily attached or detached as required.</p></li>
<li><p>Switching between setups can be done by specifying the new LOAD/SETUP
command in the input CLDATA, or by calling the new $FMSSETUP()
function in either the Gener or CeRun macro processor. For
visualization and testing purposes, setups can be manually selected
by double clicking on the setup name.</p></li>
<li><p>The CATIA and Mastercam Manufacturing Extractors have been enhanced
to recognize multiple setups as defined by the CAM system and
automatically create the setup configurations inside Virtual Machine.</p></li>
<li><p>The Part and Stock object concept has been reviewed to simplify their
usage. In V21 a Part object is composed of a Stock component
representing the raw material to be cut and a Design component
representing the planned result. The Design object is used for both
gouge detection and part comparison. Stock and Design components are
moved together by moving the Part object. The Stock/Part/Fixture
dialog was revised and is now called the <strong>Part/Fixture dialog</strong>.
Changes to the Part tab allow the Stock and Design components to be
viewed or modified from a single tab.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image37.png"><img alt="image37" src="../../_images/image37.png" style="width: 5.17in; height: 2.81801in;" /></a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A new <strong>Output</strong> field for Stock components defines the name of a
file where the final in-process stock will be saved in STL format at
the end of processing. Manufacturing Extractors that support
multi-setup will automatically set this field.</p></li>
<li><p>The in-process stock can also be saved at any time, either by
selecting a stock component (note: it must have its “Material
Removal” property enabled) and pressing the <strong>Export</strong> button, or
under macro control using the new <strong>$FMSESF</strong> function (described on
page 34)</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image38.bmp"><img alt="image38" src="../../_images/image38.bmp" style="width: 3.76in; height: 2.52in;" /></a>The <strong>Simulation»Tools/Holders/Heads dialog</strong> has been
enhanced to validate changes to tool and holder dimensions against
the Controller window tool and diameter compensation amounts. If the
tool compensation amounts do not agree with the tool definitions, a
dialog will appear (shown at right) listing the suggested tool
compensation changes highlighted in blue. Selecting OK will
automatically adjust the tool compensation for selected tools.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Controller window Tool Compensation tab also has a new <a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image39.png"><img alt="image39" src="../../_images/image39.png" style="width: 0.78115in; height: 0.20831in;" /></a>
button that can be selected at any time to check for consistency between
tool length compensation settings and the tools they are based on.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>Time Line</strong> has been further improved for V21.</p></li>
<li><p>The Time Line window now provides Tooltips, which describe the
collision, overtravel, tool, etcetera, event of interest under the
cursor. Tooltips identify the start and ending time of the event as
well as other pertinent information. For example, Spindle tooltips
indicate the spindle speed and direction of rotation. Time Line
tooltips can be enabled or disabled from the Simulation»Options
dialog Time Line tab.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image40.bmp"><img alt="image40" src="../../_images/image40.bmp" style="width: 5.03in; height: 2.25in;" /></a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Tool and Operation names now also appear in the Time Line. With Gener
operations are defined by the OPTYPE command; with CeRun operations
are defined by setting the $OPNAME system variable. On multi-channel
machines (e.g., merging lathes) there will be one Operation display
line per channel, which can aid analysis of program synchronization.
Tool and operation names are also now listed in the HUD (heads-up
display).</p></li>
<li><p>Navigation and synchronization in the Time Line window have been
improved by enabling the CTRL+HOME and CTRL+END key combinations,
which synchronize the simulation to the start or end of processing.
The F3 and SHIFT+F3 Find Next and Find Previous keys now cause a
synchronization to occur as each event is found. Double-clicking in
the Time Line window will cause a synchronization to occur at the
selected time.</p></li>
<li><p>Probe touch events can now be optionally seen and searched for in the
Time Line window, by enabling the Simulation»Options dialog Time Line
tab <em>“include probe touch events in Time Line find”</em> setting. When
enabled, searching for a next/previous collision will cause the
simulation to synchronize at probe touches.</p></li>
<li><p>The Time Line can now better handle very long jobs; processes having
a duration of up to 4 weeks can now be supported. In addition,
improvements to the navigation algorithm now permit near
instantaneous traversal between points of interest in the Time Line.</p></li>
<li><p>When running with SmartFEED, the Time Line window can switch between
its normal display (e.g., collisions, overtravel…) and a feed
optimization display. This second mode shows the effects of SmartFEED
by graphically illustrating the cutting process.</p></li>

with a control emulator, a new <strong>“Hide PP/CE Unique Data” option</strong>
when selected will perform the comparison on only those portions of
the post-processor and control emulator that are common to both. So
for example, questions concerning how PPRINT should be post-processed
will not be listed as being different, because control emulator
development does not ask about PPRINT.</p></li>

<h3>CeRun Run-Time<a class="headerlink" href="#cerun-run-time" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>As mentioned in the CAM-POST enhancements, Gener and CeRun now share
the same launch panel. This was done in support of a new V21 PSE
(<em>Post/Simulation/Emu­lation</em>) enhancement that allows Gener and CeRun
to be run in parallel or in series.</p></li>
<li><p>A new “<strong>Merged PSE Processing</strong>” launch panel setting enables
the running of Gener and CeRun in parallel. This means that as each
block of NC code is created by Gener, it is then immediately
processed by CeRun. The Virtual Machine simulation window shows and
diagnoses (i.e., checks collisions and over-travels) the results of
the CeRun simulation. If desired the simulation window can also show
the post-processor’s interpretation of the machine position and
material removal state, which can be enabled by a new “<strong>Include
GENER simulation under merged PSE</strong>” setting in the VM launch panel
tab.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image45.bmp"><img alt="image45" src="../../_images/image45.bmp" style="width: 5.12in; height: 3.3in;" /></a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Parallel processing is not available if either the post processor or
control emulator is composite or for a merging lathe machine. In this
case the “Merged PSE Processing” launch panel setting will not be
selectable. After selecting OK from the launch panel, Gener will
first run to completion and then CeRun will begin, reading the NC
code created during post-processing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of other interesting enhancements to the launch
panel, which are described starting on page 7.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Gener and CeRun must share the Statistics window and the Full
interface window when running in the new <strong>parallel processing
mode</strong>. This has required some changes to the interface, as described
below.</p></li>
<li><p>The Statistics window shows the state of both processes, side by
side. At the end of processing, separate buttons provide quick access
to the Gener and CeRun listings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image46.bmp"><img alt="image46" src="../../_images/image46.bmp" style="width: 5.73in; height: 2.1in;" /></a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The Full interface uses the multi-kernel capabilities introduced in
V20, to cleanly separate Gener and CeRun tracing and debugging.</p></li>
<li><p>The Diagnostic window and Trace windows (Input, Output, Console and
Macro) all include buttons at the upper left that allow one or the
other or both Gener and CeRun diagnostics and traces to be shown. A
“link” button appearing at the upper right of each window can be
toggled to change the information shown for individual windows (e.g.,
trace only Gener input and only CeRun output).</p></li>
<li><p>The contents of the debugging Source, Stack and Variables windows are
controlled by the Multi-Kernel toolbar, which lists the two available
kernels: Gener or CeRun. When, for example, the Gener kernel is
selected, the Source window shows the CLDATA file and post-processor
macros, the Call Stack window shows the post-processor calling stack,
and the Variables window shows post-processor variables. When the
CeRun kernel is selected, the Source window shows the NC code
(generated to the current time) and control emulator macros, the Call
Stack window shows the control emulator calling stack, and the
Variables window shows control emulator variables.</p></li>
<li><p>The Simulation window by default shows the results from control
emulation, but when the “Include GENER simulation under merged PSE”
setting in the VM launch panel tab is selected, then the Multi-Kernel
toolbar selects which of the two Virtual Machine sessions to view
(they should be identical within a block or two).</p></li>
<li><p>The Status bar shows information for both processes, but the progress
completion bar is based on progression through the CLDATA file by the
post-processor.</p></li>
<li><p>Gener and CeRun each run independently when <strong>running in series</strong>,
but there have been some changes made to the interface that are
necessary because of the automatic start of CeRun processing after
Gener processing has completed.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image47.bmp"><img alt="image47" src="../../_images/image47.bmp" style="width: 3.21in; height: 2.27in;" /></a>The Gener Statistics window has a new CeRun button that
can be activated once post-processing has completed. This provides an
opportunity to view the post-processor results before CeRun
processing is started.</p></li>
<li><p>When post-processing has completed, the Gener Full interface progress
bar window will indicate that the Play button must be selected to
start CeRun processing.</p></li>
<li><p>The CeRun Full Interface has a new <strong>File»SaveForReview</strong> function
that will save the current state of control emulation into a ZRJ file
for later review. Explicitly saving the process inhibits the
automatic save that normally occurs at the end of processing when the
“save for review” launch panel preference is selected. This function
is not available (at present) when running Gener and CeRun in
parallel.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>CERUN»Code Groups window</strong> now lists the codes by their MCD
representation as well as by their CeRun code_xxx name. E.g., G90,
code_position_absolute. This feature was added in V20-1307.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image48.bmp"><img alt="image48" src="../../_images/image48.bmp" style="width: 4.81in; height: 2.41in;" /></a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If the Control-Out and Start-of-DISPLAY characters are the same
(General Description / Output Format questions #2.6 and #16), then
CeRun will resolve the ambiguity by assume all such text is tape
commentary and will not output it to the Console trace window.</p></li>

<h2>Macros and Customization<a class="headerlink" href="#macros-and-customization" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<section id="all-products">
<h3>All Products<a class="headerlink" href="#all-products" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The following macro enhancements apply to all products.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A new <strong>Declar</strong><strong>ation Macro</strong> is available at the top of the
Startup/Shutdown Macros section during post-processor, model and
control emulator macro development. This macro in combination with a
new “strong declaration” feature are designed to help developers
create more stable macro code and catch misspellings and improper use
of variables in Quest instead of at run-time (if at all).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of the declaration macro is to provide a standard place
where GLOBAL, OBJECT and FUNCTION variables can be declared and
optionally assigned an initial value. No other commands can be specified
in a declaration macro.</p>
<p>A new <strong>Strong Declaration</strong> setting is now available when compiling
macros. There are 3 settings that control how strict the macro processor
is concerning where and when variables are declared.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>OFF</strong>: Variables can be declared when and wherever desired, in the
same way as they always have. This is the default setting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>PARTIAL</strong>: GLOBAL, OBJECT and FUNCTION variables can only be
declared in the new Declaration Macro. LOCAL variables do not have to
be declared.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FULL</strong>: Same as PARTIAL, but LOCAL variables must be declared in a
macro before being used.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Full interface Tools»Preferences dialog Debug tab also permits the
Strong Declaration setting to be changed at run-time (this setting is
stored in the Registry and shared with Quest). The Debug tab also has a
new “<strong>warn about uninitialized variables</strong>” setting, that when
selected will diagnose whenever a macro variable is used in an
expression before it has been assigned a value. The macro processor has
a default assignment that it has always used in such cases, but it is
not good programming practice to rely on these defaults, and in some
cases this may be unintended.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The macro processor now supports a <strong>SEQUENCE</strong> type in the DECLAR
command, to strongly declare a variable as being a sequence type.</p></li>
<li><p>The DECLAR command now allows arrays to be declared having up to <strong>4
dimensions</strong> (the previous limit was 1). For example,
DECLAR/REAL,TABLE(100,3) defines an array of 100 rows and 3 columns.
Some points of note:</p></li>
<li><p>Arrays are possible for all data types excluding sequences (a
sequence is a variable-length single-dimensioned array).</p></li>
<li><p>String arrays will now have a fixed length of 256 characters per
string element, which is the maximum string length permitted by the
macro processor. In earlier releases strings in arrays had a length
of 80 characters unless RESERV was specified to change the length.
RESERV is not available for multi-dimensioned arrays and has been
removed from the documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Variables can now be assigned a value at the same time as they are
created with the DECLAR command. To assign a value to the variable
being declared, simply follow the variable name with an
“=<em>expression</em>” assignment. Sequences can be assigned values when
created by following the sequence variable name with an
“={<em>expression-list</em>}” assignment. Arrays cannot be assigned values
when declared. For example:</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">DECLAR/OBJECT,REAL,DEG2RAD=$PI/180</div>
<div class="line">DECLAR/OBJECT,SEQUENCE,ONOFF={ON,OFF}</div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added support for the <strong>+=, –=, /=</strong> and <strong>*=</strong> macro operators
commonly used in C and other programming languages. These operators
provide the following functionality when used with numeric variables
and constants:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>V21</em>   <em>V20</em></p>
<p>A+=B A=A+B</p>
<p>A–=B A=A–B</p>
<p>A/=B A=A/B</p>
<p>A*=B A=A*B</p>
<p>The += operator can also be used with sequence and string variables and
constants, to append one sequence to another, or one string to another.</p>
<p><em>V21</em>   <em>V20</em></p>
<p>A+={B} A={A,B}</p>
<p>A+=B A=A//B</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>External functions have always required a link between the
DECLAR/EXTERN,FUNCTN command in the macro processor and the DLL
(dynamic link library) file on the computer that contains the
compiled code of the external function. These external function DLLs
can now be copied into the Quest <strong>file storage</strong> section, and then
referenced in the DECLAR command using the ICAMFS universal URL. For
example:</p></li>
</ul>
<p>DECLAR/EXTERN,FUNCTN,'//ICAMFS/<em>code</em>.dll',<em>name</em>(<em>arguments</em>)</p>
<p>Similarly, EXE (executable) files can also be copied to the Quest file
storage section, and then referenced in the SYSTEM command using the
ICAMFS universal URL. For example:</p>
<p>SYSTEM/'//ICAMFS/<em>name</em>.exe <em>arguments</em>'</p>
<p>This simplifies distribution and versioning of post-processors, control
emulators or models that would normally have relied on external
libraries or other executable programs.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>New <strong>Output Format Descriptors</strong> are now available to handle spacing
and sequence numbers in the output string.</p></li>
<li><p>New <strong>!(Tn)</strong> and <strong>!(tn)</strong> “tab” output format descriptors
advance to the specified character position <em>“n”</em> in the output
string and then continue output from there. The uppercase !(T<em>n</em>)
descriptor advances to the specified character position or to the end
of the string, whichever is higher. The lowercase !(t<em>n</em>)
descriptor will position to the specified character, truncating the
string if it is larger. These format descriptors are designed to
simplify the generation of tabulated output.</p></li>
<li><p>New <strong>!(&#64;N)</strong> and <strong>!&#64;N</strong> predefined sequence number output format
descriptors can be used to output either a specified N block value,
or the next N block in sequence. These format descriptors are
designed to provide control over sequence numbering in INSERT
commands when automatic output of N blocks with INSERT is disabled.</p></li>
<li><p>A new <strong>!(F+sn.ns)</strong> numeric output register format is
available to output a value with a fixed output width. It is similar
to the !(X+s<em>n</em>.<em>n</em>s) format, except that the ± sign floats to
the left of the first digit rather than occupying the first column of
output.</p></li>
<li><p>Some improvements have been made to <strong>macro CASE processing</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>When tracing a CASE statement in the Source window using the
Debug»Step Into or Step Over functions, processing now skips directly
to the matching WHEN condition. In prior releases, you had to step
past each non-matching WHEN before reaching the matching WHEN, which
was inconvenient on large CASE blocks. Non-matching WHEN conditions
are no longer traced in macro output.</p></li>
<li><p>The Quest macro compiler now accepts constant system variables $PI,
$TRUE, $FALSE and $NULL as matching WHEN conditions. These are the
only variables that are allowed in a WHEN statement.</p></li>
<li><p>The following <strong>general functions</strong> are new for this release:</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>$FGCYPT3</strong>(<em>p1,p2,p3</em>) function returns an
{<em>x,y,z,i,j,k,r</em>} sequence defining the center, vector and radius of
a cylinder constructed through 3 points, each defined as an {<em>x,y,z</em>}
sequence. The cylinder axis is perpendicular to a plane constructed
through the 3 points, and has the 3 points along its circumference.
$NULL is returned if the points all lie on the same line.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$FGPLPTN</strong>(<em>point,vector</em>) function returns a {<em>d,i,j,k</em>}
sequence of a plane that passes through a point defined by an {x,y,z}
sequence and is perpendicular to a vector defined by an {i,j,k}
sequence.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>$SEQALLOC</strong> variable defines how internal memory should be
allocated when sequence variables are created and when they grow in
size. This increase in size occurs when the new += operator is used
to append to an existing sequence, or when a sequence variable is
overwritten by a larger sequence, as in A={A,B} or even A={B}. Note
that internal allocation size is not the same as the actual size of a
sequence as determined using $FLEN().</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This subject is covered in more detail in the documentation, but in
brief, setting $SEQALLOC=0 (the default) will generally result in
significantly faster macro processing of sequences, whereas setting
$SEQALLOC=1 will maintain the same allocation strategy and speed as for
earlier releases.</p>

<span id="id3"></span><h3>CAM-POST<a class="headerlink" href="#cam-post-1" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The following macro enhancements apply when using CAM-POST.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A new <strong>Register Macro</strong> is available when post-processing. This
macro is run whenever a matching register is to be output. The macro
provides the following $P variables:</p></li>
</ul>
<p>$P1 Set to 0 on return to inhibit output of register</p>
<p>$P2 String containing the formatted register value</p>
<p>$P3 Register index number in the Register Table</p>
<p>$P4 Unformatted value of the register</p>
<p>The $P2 value contains the formatted register value that will be output
to tape when the macro exits. $P2 can be changed in the macro (in the
same way that $P3 can be changed in a Tape Macro). Setting $P1=0
inhibits the output of the register value.</p>
<p>A new $FREGFMT(<em>n</em>) function returns a $FSWRIT() compatible output
format descriptor of a register index “<em>n</em>”, which can be used to
modify the $P2 formatted register value as a function of the $P4
unformatted register value. For example, to output SIN instead of
degrees:</p>
<p>$P2=$FSWRIT($FREGFMT($P3),$FSIN($P4))</p>
<p>By default the register macro executes for every register that is
output. This default behaviour can be changed by using the new $REGMAC
and $REGMATCH variables described on page 32.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>PPFUN/23</strong> command provides new options to enable/disable the
recording of travel and timing information.</p></li>
<li><p>PPFUN/23,ON-OFF enables/disables the recording of tool travel

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>$APIDS</strong> variable when non-zero indicates that the current
motion sequence was generated by SmartPATH during an entry from or
exit to a reference home position. When $APIDS is less than 0,
$FAPPOS(1) returns the entry position in workpiece coordinates. When
$APIDS is greater than 0, $FAPPOS($APIDS) returns the exit position
in workpiece coordinates.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$FREGFMT(reg)</strong> function takes as input either a register index
number, or a text string matching one or more characters of a
register’s descriptor. It returns a format string that can be used
with the $FSWRIT() function to output a register value. This function
was designed to be used in the register macro to modify register
values. E.g., $P2=$FSWRIT($FREGFMT($P3),ƒ($P4))</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$KIT</strong> variable contains the name of the CAM interface kit, or
is blank if an interface kit is not being used.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$LABINC</strong> variable holds the label number increment. This
increment is added to the current label number after a label is
output to generate a new current label number.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$LABNO</strong> variable contains the current label number to use if a
label is required to be output.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$REG</strong><strong>MAC</strong> variable controls execution of the register
macro. The register macro is executed only if this variable is set to
$TRUE. It is initialized to $TRUE by Gener. If it is set to $FALSE,
the register macro will not be executed.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$REGMATCH</strong> sequence variable defines the registers that are
candidates for matching with the register macro. If empty or $NULL,
all registers are candidates for matching. The $REGMATCH sequence can
contain zero or more register index numbers and zero or more text
strings matching one or more characters of a register’s descriptor.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$SKIPCOD</strong> variable indicates the current probe “skip code”
status. A value of 0 indicates that skip code processing is not
active; a value of 1 indicates the function is active. When active
and simulation is enabled, a probe touch event stops further axis
motion for the current block. This variable is settable.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$SKIPERR</strong> variable indicates the probe “skip code” state
recorded at the end of the last motion. A value of 0 indicates no
error. A value of 1 indicates a touch event occurred. A value of 2
indicates that a touch event did not occur.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$SPACE</strong> variable controls the output of register spacing.
Register spacing is enabled when this variable is set $TRUE and
register spacing is supported (Quest General Description / Output
Format question #2.5 “SPACE code”). It is initialized to $TRUE by
Gener. If it is set to $FALSE, then spacing will be disabled on
subsequent output.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$TLSUM</strong> variable now includes two additional columns recording
spindle speed information. $TLSUM(6,<em>n</em>) is the minimum speed in
RPM used by tool <em>n</em>. $TLSUM(7,<em>n</em>) is the maximum speed in RPM
used by tool <em>n</em>. The minimum and maximum spindle speeds are
initialized to zero, and are recorded at the endpoint of each motion
if the spindle is turning.</p></li>

<li><p>The <strong>$FREGFMT(reg)</strong> function takes as input either a register index
number, or a text string matching one or more characters of a
register’s descriptor. It returns a format string that can be used
with the $FSWRIT() function to output a register value. This function
can be used with EXEC commands to produce NC code that conforms to
the register format.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$OPNAME</strong> variable can be set to identify the name of the
current operation. This information is used in the Statistics window
as well as in the simulation Time Line window and HUD display.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$SKIPCOD</strong> variable indicates the current probe “skip code”
status. A value of 0 indicates that skip code processing is not
active; a value of 1 indicates the function is active. When active
and simulation is enabled, a probe touch event stops further axis
motion for the current block. This variable is settable.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$SKIPERR</strong> variable indicates the probe “skip code” state
recorded at the end of the last motion. A value of 0 indicates no
error. A value of 1 indicates a touch event occurred. A value of 2
indicates that a touch event did not occur.</p></li>

spindle speed information. $TLSUM(6,<em>n</em>) is the minimum speed in
RPM used by tool <em>n</em>. $TLSUM(7,<em>n</em>) is the maximum speed in RPM
used by tool <em>n</em>. The minimum and maximum spindle speeds are
initialized to zero, and are recorded at the endpoint of each motion
if the spindle is turning.</p></li>

<h2>CAM Interfaces<a class="headerlink" href="#cam-interfaces" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A new <strong>SYNEX command</strong> is available when reading APT source into the
post-processor. This command is similar to the textual SYN command,
except that it supports matching and substitution using regular
expressions in the same way that the $FEDIT function does.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image53.png"><img alt="image53" src="../../_images/image53.png" style="height: 30px;" /></a></p>
<p>By default the substitution is applied individually to the case
sensitive aptsource lines as they are read. Specify LAST to instead
apply the substitution to the final record, which omits comments,
concatenates continued lines, and (except for strings) removes all
spacing and converts characters to uppercase.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>TRACUT, INDEX and COPY commands</strong> can now optionally be processed
during the conversion from aptsource input to internal binary CLDATA
format.</p></li>
<li><p>TRACUT processing during aptsource input is controlled by the
following command:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image54.png"><img alt="image54" src="../../_images/image54.png" style="height: 90px;" /></a></p>
<p>ON enables processing of TRACUT commands in the ANSI APT standard order
TRACUT ⇨ COPY ⇨ TRACUT/LAST. LAST enables processing in the CATIA order
COPY ⇨ TRACUT ⇨ TRACUT/LAST. OFF (which is the default) passes TRACUT
commands unmodified to the post-processor. Note however that the
post-processor does not support TRACUT.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>INDEX and COPY processing during aptsource input is controlled by the
following command:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image55.png"><img alt="image55" src="../../_images/image55.png" style="height: 60px;" /></a></p>
<p>ON enables processing of INDEX and COPY commands. OFF (which is the
default) passes INDEX and COPY commands unmodified to the
post-processor, where they can either be expanded or converted to
subprogram processing depending on Quest or DEFSUB/INDEX command
preferences.</p>
<p>APT processors from different vendors have applied nested COPY matrix
multiplication in different ways. The following command defines the
matrix multiplication order:</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image56.png"><img alt="image56" src="../../_images/image56.png" style="height: 60px;" /></a></p>
<p>ON performs nested COPY matrix processing in the same order as is used
by CATIA and by APT/AC. OFF (which is the default) conforms to the order
used by CAM-APT-SURF, APT-III, APT-IV and APT 360.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>CIR_DIR definition</strong> file symbol now permits a NONE setting (in
addition to CLW and CCLW) in support of the Featurecam CIRCLE
command. This setting ignores the circle command vector and instead
takes the shortest path to the arc end-point.</p></li>
<li><p>Siemens NX 7.0 and higher now support an <strong>ICAM_CLSF template</strong> that
can be used in place of the CLSF_ADVANCED or CLSF_STANDARD, to
produce aptsource that directly conforms to ICAM requirements. The
ICAM template provides a much more complete conversion of MOM data to
aptsource, and also corrects for a number of problems in the NX
supplied templates, which are no longer being maintained by Siemens.</p></li>
<li><p>All <strong>Manufacturing Extractors</strong> have been enhanced to eliminate the
requirement for a config.xml file to be present defining extractor
options. The additional information that used to be required in the
config.xml file is now obtained directly from the selected
post-processor, model or control emulator.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Manufacturing extractors have been “unified”, meaning that they have a
common interface and behaviour. The interface has been simplified, to
present the manufacturing process data in as clear and complete a
fashion as possible, and to reduce as much as possible the requirement
to input additional data to obtain a complete extraction.</p>
<p>Manufacturing extractors also have a flexible tool control, which
captures the tool alignment from the CAM system, and intelligently
applies it to the model. The user has full control over the orientation
and location of tools in the model, for example choosing between upper
and lower turrets of a merging lathe.</p>
<p>Manufacturing extractors are also now being enhanced to support the
concept of multiple setups. Initially, varying degrees of multi-setup
support are available for CATIA, Creo2 and Mastercam X8. These and other
extractors will continue to be enhanced for multi-setup support as
resources permit.</p>
<p>The following is a list of current extractors and the more significant
enhancements that have been made since the last release.</p>
<ul class="simple">

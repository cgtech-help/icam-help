<h3>Quest Developer’s<a class="headerlink" href="#quest-developers" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The questionnaire has been enhanced with new questions, as follows.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>General Information / General Information</em> section question #3
“Machine type” now includes a “Mill-Turn” choice, which is equivalent
to selecting the “Lathe” type and then answering “Yes” to question
#31 “Does the machine have a C axis”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When question #74 “Positioning mode change method: [Codes,Register]” is
answered “Register”, QUEST will perform a consistency check when
“Generating” to ensure that all axes related registers have an
incremental register name defined.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <em>General Description / Registers</em> section has a new “Use default
resolution/‌minimum/‌maximum values” check-box on the horizontal
splitter bar. When checked, all resolution and most minimum/‌maximum
questions will not be asked. Instead, the resolution, minimum and
maximum values will be set based on the register format. This setting
is remembered on an individual post-processor and control emulator
basis. The default for new post-processors and control emulators is
to use the default resolution, minimum and maximum values (i.e., to
not ask these questions).</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>General Information / Display Format</em> section now provides an
additional option for rotary column display, to restrict the output
to signed modulo-360 values. Previously, output could either list the
rotary axis angle as-is, or as an absolute modulo-360 value.
[V22-1719]</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>General Information / Output Format</em> section includes a new
question #9 “Output MAIN and SIDE programs to a single file” that is
asked for merging lathes with dual-program output. If “Yes”, the side
head NC program is appended to the main head NC program file. BREAK
command processing is disabled when using a single combined tape
file.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Machine Description / Tool Change</em> section question #9 (#14 if
lathe) “Tool change reference point (G) code” now permits an NA
response, which uses the same (G) code as defined in the <em>Machine
Description / Home Position and Reference Point</em> section. Use this to
avoid the Quest “conflicting codes” diagnostic. The same NA choice is
now also available for the “Head change reference point (G) code”
question. [V22‑1706]</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Machine Description / Feedrate</em> section includes a new question
#90 “Adjust feed based on machine limitations” that defines if Gener
should adjust the programmed feed to respect the machine axes feed
velocity limitations. The default for existing post-processors is
“Yes”; the default for new post-processors is “No”. Regardless of the
response, the feed will be adjusted if necessary to suit CNC feed
register limitations and feed timing calculations will take all
limitations into account. This setting can be controlled at run-time
using a new FEDRAT/ADJUST,ON-OFF command.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Feedrate section also includes a new question #91 “Default tool
length for 5-axis feed calculations” that defines the length of the tool
that is used for feed coverage testing purposes when motions contain a
rotary axis component. The default has always been 1 “primary” unit;
this question provides a means of changing the default, including using
a value of zero. This setting can be controlled at run-time using the
FEDRAT/LENGTH command.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <em>Machine Description / Spindle</em> section includes a new question
#46 “SFM/SMM controlling head selection: [NA,Codes,Values]” that is
asked for merging lathes. A “Codes” response can be used, for
example, to define G110 and G111 controlling heads codes used by
Okuma. A “Values” response can be used, for example, to define L1 and
L2 controlling head settings used by Mazak. All spindle section
questions have been grouped for better readability. New run-time
diagnostic 01327009 is now output if the requested CSS exceeds the
machine limit.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Control Description / Coordinate System</em> section now includes a
new “standard vs. list encoding” question #10.7 that simplifies the
output of subprogram style MCD for a translation LCS. This matches
functionality added in V22 for a rotation LCS.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Control Description / Circular and Helical Interpolation</em>
section question #35 “Multiple turns” now includes a new “Helical”
response that limits the multiple turns feature to only those arcs
that have a helical component. For V21 and V22 builds 1835 and later,
set $ICCIR(65)=2 in the Machine Startup macro to achieve the same.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Automated Canned Cycles / General Drill Cycle Information</em>
section question #2.1 “Cancel cycle code required between cycles” has
a new “Always” choice, which when selected will result in a cancel
cycle code being output when CYCLE/OFF is coded, even if the next
motion reactivates the same cycle. This maintains V21 and earlier
behavior. [V22‑1713]</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Automated Canned Cycles / Thread Cycles</em> section has an improved
question layout. There are also new questions #117 and #217 “Omit
variable lead register when value is zero” to omit the single- and/or
multi-pass variable lead register for constant lead threads. A new
multi-pass question #204 “Double line threading cycle” provides the
ability to define the Fanuc standard G76 P<em>mmrraa</em> thread cycle
parameter block. New question #255 “CNC tool nose offset” defines,
for multi-pass threading, the way in which the CNC advances the tool
along its edge from one thread step depth to another (this
distinction is important for Virtual Machine simulation). New
questions #266-269 provide the ability to define a fixed or variable
minimum thread step distance.</p></li>
<li><p>A new <em>Optional Post-processor Words / AM Command</em> section provides
control over an AM (Additive Manufacturing) device. AM is a process
that builds 3D objects by adding layer-upon-layer of material. In a
CNC machine context, AM generally refers to Directed Energy
Deposition (DED) devices. This new section supports the definition of
AM activation and deactivation codes as well as support for an
optional power setting. Additive Manufacturing (available with an xhy
license option) is supported in Gener, CeRun and Virtual Machine.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Optional Post-processor Words / COOLNT Command</em> section now
permits a “primary” coolant type (e.g., FLOOD, THRU…) to be defined
instead as an individually ON-OFF controlled “auxiliary” coolant
type, provided that a primary coolant (M) code is not already defined
for that type. [V22-1738]</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Optional Post-processor Words / COUPLE Command</em> section question
#4 “End threading (G) code” now supports a NA response, to be used
when threading is cancelled by another interpolation code. New
questions #20 “Always output feedrate when threading: [Yes,No,First]”
and #21 “Always output feedrate after threading: [Yes,No]”, control
the output modality of the thread feed or lead register. By default,
feed information is output on all threading blocks and on the first
feed motion that follows. Question #71 “Variable lead (G) code” now
supports NA as a response, meaning that the constant lead (G) code is
also used to create variable lead threads. Use this to avoid the
Quest “conflicting codes” diagnostic.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Optional Post-processor Words / HEAD Command</em> section now
includes a new question #10 “Program identification method:
[NA,Codes,Values]” that is asked for merging lathes with dual-program
output. A “Codes” response can be used, for example, to define G13
and G14 program identifications used by Okuma. A “Values” response
can be used, for example, to define G109 L1 and G109 L2 program
identifications used by Mazak.</p></li>
<li><p>The (G) and (M) code questions now support codes with a single
decimal value in the range 0 through 999.9, without having to use the
ALT functionality. Quest also now outputs consistency warnings when
“Generating” if the code value cannot be formatted using the defined
(G) or (M) register.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Customization</em> section has been enhanced as follows:</p></li>
<li><p>New <em>LCS Startup / Shutdown macros</em> are now available with the
post-processor to simplify customization of NC code generation and
processing when a change of local coordinate system occurs. The $P
variables of the LCS startup macro provide access to the $LCS…
variables in advance of the LCS actually being activated.</p></li>
<li><p>A new <em>User Function Macros</em> section provides a place to create
user-defined macro functions (new for V23) to be used in
post-processor, control emulator or model macros. Macro user-defined
functions are similar to user-defined functions, except that they
accept parameters and return a value in the same way that built-in
and external user-defined functions do.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>User-defined macro functions can also be saved to a file on disk or to
the //ICAMFS internal file storage area, and then later loaded into any
post-processor, control emulator or model that requires them, by using
the INCLUD/'<em>filename</em>' command (ideally in the Declaration macro). This
feature is designed to promote standardization of common macros at a
facility. Macro functions defined in the User Function Macros section do
not need to be declared in the Declaration macro or INCLUD’ed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Model development enhancements:</p></li>
<li><p>It is now possible to organize the movable axes of the model into
multiple Controller»Axes tabs, define custom names for each of the
additional axes tabs, control the order in which axes are listed in
each tab, control the order in which axes tabs are listed, and hide
those tabs and/or axes that should not be controlled at run-time by
the user. Axes tab customization is stored with the model. Hidden
axes and tabs can be unhidden at run-time unless the model is
Dedicated.</p></li>
<li><p>When running with an Advanced Model license option, the currently
loaded model can be exported in ICAM M3D text format using a new
Simulation»Export Model menu selection. Edited M3D models can be
reloaded using the Import Model menu selection, replacing the model
being edited. Extreme care must be taken when editing models in this
fashion. The Import Model function also supports the import of
Vericut machine models in MCH file format.</p></li>
<li><p>The automatic creation of mill-turn and merging lathe models from a
post-processor or control emulator has been improved. Reference axes
are also now used to simply reorienting between horizontal and
vertical machine types.</p></li>
<li><p>STL mesh files can now be dropped onto the Mesh Properties dialog
instead of having to browse for the STL file using the [Import]
button. The units of input will be as last specified; the format of
input will be “Automatic”.</p></li>
<li><p>A new [Smoothing] button is available on the Mesh Properties dialog.
With this feature you can eliminate the facetted look of surfaces
that in reality should be smooth. Smoothing relies on a user
specified angle threshold that it applies to the entire mesh. When
the angle between adjacent faces is less than this threshold, VM will
show the edge with a smooth transition in the same way that it does
when you create a Cylinder or Cone object. Otherwise, VM will show
the edge as a sharp line in the same way that a Cylinder or Cone is
shown when “Use sharp edges” is selected. Specifying an angle of 0
resets the mesh to the original sharp edge representation.</p></li>
<li><p>Other Quest enhancements:</p></li>
<li><p>Test cldata files can be dropped onto the Quest Test window instead
of having to browse for the test file.</p></li>
<li><p>The Quest Database Navigator now has new “Close All” and
“Close All But This” choices to simplify development when working
with a large number of databases.</p></li>
<li><p>The interface kit is now listed in the Quest status bar. This can be
pertinent as the interface kit usually defines the keywords file,
which affects the User Defined words list and macro processing. Note
that an “Automatic” kit uses the default word definitions.</p></li>

<section id="gener-post-processing">
<h3>Gener Post-processing<a class="headerlink" href="#gener-post-processing" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Adaptive post-processing permits the NC programmer to concentrate
solely on cutting tool-paths, leaving the connecting positioning
tool-paths to be automatically generated by SmartPATH; long entry,
exit and non-cutting feed motions to be minimized by SmartCUT; and
cutting feed rates to be optimized by SmartFEED. These three modules
are collectively known as SmartPACK. They have been continually
improved and fine-tuned.</p></li>
<li><p>SmartPATH has been enhanced to support positioning tool in and out of
deep pockets, where there is very little room between the tool and
pocket walls. SmartPATH also has been improved to develop optimal
positioning paths when angled tool heads/‌holders are used. SmartPATH
has been fine tuned to produce more esthetically pleasing symmetrical
retract/plunge paths where this does not increase the overall
positioning time.</p></li>
<li><p>SmartCUT has been enhanced to test the volume of material removed on
RAPID axial moves (i.e., retract or plunge), and if the volume is
zero (i.e., a touch but not a cut), then SmartCUT ignores the “touch”
condition. This enables rapid positioning directly along the tool
axis when it is safe to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>Post-processor commands have been enhanced to provide new
functionality as follows:</p></li>
<li><p>A new <strong>AM</strong> command supports Additive Manufacturing (available with
an xhy license option). The AM/ON command enables material
deposition; AM/OFF disables deposition. An optional POWER value is
available where necessary to control the deposition process.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>AUXFUN</strong>, <strong>PREFUN</strong> and <strong>PPFUN</strong>/7 commands now support a
trailing “SAME,‌<em>register</em>(<em>s</em>)” option, which defers the normal
output of the command until such time as one of the registers listed
to the right of the SAME keyword is next output. The registers can be
defined by any combination of register descriptor string (to a
maximum of 6 characters as usual), register index number, standard
axis keyword or XYZ (implies X or Y or Z axis).</p></li>

<li><p>The <strong>HEAD</strong> command for merging lathes now supports a MANUAL option,
which inhibits the output of the head synchronization code. Coding
HEAD/MANUAL,BOTH produces the same effect as adding MANUAL to the
first HEAD/MAIN and HEAD/SIDE commands in the block. A
HEAD/MANUAL,OFF inhibits the output of synchronization codes at the
end of the merged block.</p></li>

<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image41.png"><img alt="image4" src="../../_images/image41.png" style="height: 60px;" /></a></p>
<p>The HEAD command now also supports a “[,SPINDL],{MAIN|SIDE|<em>n</em>}”
option to define the controlling spindle. This sets the $SHEAD system
variable, which controls the output of the new SFM/SMM controlling head
codes. Coding this new option (or setting $SHEAD in a macro to a value
of 1 or 2) will inhibit the automatic setting of $SHEAD when a SPINDL
command is encountered.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>LCS/AUTO</strong> command has been enhanced as follows:</p></li>
<li><p>A new “FEED,ON-OFF” parameter is now available to indicate whether or
not high-feed positioning motions should also be candidates for
automatic LCS processing in the same way that RAPID motions are. (The
high-feed positioning threshold is set via the FEDRAT/RAPID command.)
[V22-1749]</p></li>
<li><p>The “AUTO,<em>mode</em>” parameter now accepts a new “0” value for
<em>mode</em>, which provides separate ON and OFF parameters to specify the
conditions for automatic LCS activation and deactivation. Mode 0 is
the default when running with a V23 generated post.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The “ON,<em>n</em>” activation possibilities are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>inhibits activation</p></li>
<li><p>at the end of the positioning sequence</p></li>
<li><p>after the last positioning motion containing a rotary motion
(default)</p></li>
<li><p>same as 2, or before the last positioning motion, whichever occurs
last</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The “OFF,<em>n</em>” deactivation possibilities are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>inhibits deactivation</p></li>
<li><p>at the start of the positioning sequence</p></li>
<li><p>before the first positioning motion containing a rotary motion
(default)</p></li>
<li><p>same as 2, or after the first positioning motion, whichever occurs
first</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>LIMIT</strong> command has been enhanced to provide a means of
defining the tool length compensation and machine workpiece (fixture)
compensation amounts currently in effect.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image61.png"><img alt="image6" src="../../_images/image61.png" style="height: 30px;" /></a></p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image71.png"><img alt="image7" src="../../_images/image71.png" style="height: 30px;" /></a></p>
<p>When compensation amounts are defined, Gener can better diagnose
over-travel conditions. New $[NL]*J “joint” system variables can be used
to obtain the as-compensated axes positions during macro processing. The
LIMIT/POLAR command now takes workpiece compensation into account when
computing polar interpolation optimizations.</p>
<p>The LIMIT command has also been enhanced to adjust Virtual Machine axes
limits for those axes controlled by Gener. This same functionality is
also available using a new $FMSLIMIT function. [V22-1751]</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image81.png"><img alt="image8" src="../../_images/image81.png" style="height: 30px;" /></a></p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image92.png"><img alt="image9" src="../../_images/image92.png" style="height: 120px;" /></a></p>
<p>This command sets or restores travel limit min/max ranges for the names
axes (e.g., XAXIS, YAXIS…). The ON-OFF keywords can be used with rotary
axes to enable/disable travel checking.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>LINTOL</strong> command has been enhanced to improve control of rotary
axes for applications like additive machining, water-jet and flame
cutting, where it is better to sacrifice some rotational accuracy in
order to avoid dwells caused by large rotary motions near rotary axis
singularities. A new “THRU,<em>angle</em>” parameter specifies the
maximum allowable angular deviation permitted.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>MCHTOL</strong> command processing has been enhanced to fully support
HSM emulation and simulation when running with RTCP and/or LCS
active. HSM adjusted feed information is now sent to Virtual Machine
for more accurate simulation. Previously, HSM was only supported when
the axes of tape output matched the physical axes of the machine.
Note that the MCHTOL command and its related Quest <em>Control
Description / High Speed Machining</em> section require the HSM license
option.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>SAFETY</strong> command has a new option that provides a means of
overriding the default rotary axes behavior during various types of
positioning motions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image102.png"><img alt="image10" src="../../_images/image102.png" style="height: 120px;" /></a></p>
<p>This command can force GENER to maintain the same rotary pose on
retract, plunge and other types of positioning motions, when it is not
safe to switch to the alternate rotary configuration.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>THREAD/ON</strong> command has been enhanced as follows:</p></li>
<li><p>All PITCH command parameters can now be specified on the THREAD
command, eliminating the requirement to spread thread parameters
across two commands.</p></li>
<li><p>The “CUTANG,<em>angle</em>” parameter is now optional. If omitted, the
entry angle will be computed based on the initial tool position with
respect to the first GOTO motion in the THREAD/ON-OFF block.</p></li>
<li><p>A new “RETURN[,<em>distance</em>]” parameter is now available to more
easily define the thread clearance retract distance applied between
each thread pass. If the optional <em>distance</em> value is omitted, the
retract height is defined by the initial position before the
THREAD/ON-OFF block.</p></li>
<li><p>A new “CHAMFR,<em>length</em>[,<em>angle</em>]” parameter provides an
alternative method to “ATANGL,<em>angle</em>[,<em>height</em>]” of defining
the thread chamfer. The CHAMFR parameter defines a chamfer with an
<em>angle</em> between 10 and 80 degrees (default 45), and with a defined
<em>length</em> along the primary thread axis (as is commonly defined on the
CNC). A negative length applies the chamfer within the body of the
thread instead of adding it to the end of the thread. A length of 0
(zero) indicates that a chamfer is not required.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of THREAD command enhancements and new <em>Automated Canned
Cycles / Thread Cycles</em> section questions will simplify support for CNC
single- and multi-pass threading cycles.</p>
<p>A large number of threading related corrections have been made to the
post-processor and to simulation of threading with Virtual Machine.

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Virtual Machine est maintenant disponible en français.</p></li>
<li><p>A new “additive” tool type is available to describe the tooling used
for Additive Manufacturing (AM) and Directed Energy Deposition (DED)
devices (available with an xhy license option). An additive tool has
both a physical body definition (i.e., the tool profile) and a
definition of the region where material will be applied when the
device is on (i.e., the AM profile). When an additive tool is active,
material removal simulation (MRS) adds material to the in-process
stock rather than removing it as usual.</p></li>
<li><p>When Virtual Machine is used with Gener, new ADAPTV/PROTCT command
options TRAV and ALL can be specified so that Gener path planning and
optimization features use the model travel limits (which take tool
length, tool diameter and workpiece compensations into account),
instead of the post-processor defined travel limits. The PROTCT
options are as follows:</p></li>

</table>
<p>The SCAN method now inhibits VM processing during path-planning
look-ahead since VM has no effect on the path-planning outcome. This can
significantly speed path-planning look-ahead. [V22‑1739]</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image112.png"><img alt="Multi-core speed optimization setting" src="../../_images/image112.png" style="width: 3in; height: 0.92in;" /></a>The Simulations»Options»MRS
dialog has a new multi-core speed optimization set­ting that enables
multiple cores of the CPU to be used simultaneously to speed
calculation of the in-process stock. Buf­fering cuts and periodically
performing stock calculations provides for faster overall execution,
however with regular pauses each time the buffer fills. [V22‑1736]</p></li>
<li><p>Axes travel limits can be adjusted at run-time using a new $FMSLIMIT
macro function and/or LIMIT/SIMUL post-processor command. The
$FMSLIMIT function provides the ability to query, modify, remove
and/or reset the travel limitations of linear and rotary model axis.
The LIMIT/SIMUL command provides the ability to modify, remove or
reset travel limitations of model axes controlled by the Gener
kernel. [V22-1751]</p></li>
<li><p>Flute length optimization performance can be significantly improved
by using an alternate method to compute the required flute length.
Previously, the minimum flute length was calculated by testing the
entire tool for the portion “touching” the in-process stock, whether
cutting or not. This is a CPU intensive calculation. An alternate
method is now available, which computes the minimum flute length
based on the cutting portion of the tool that is actually “cutting”
the in-process stock. This nearly doubles processing speed. The
choice of method is controlled by a new “METHOD,<em>n</em>” parameter on
the ADAPTV/‌DEPTH command, with the default being the quicker method.</p></li>
<li><p>Machine simulation and material removal simulation of lathe threading
operations have been improved. Variable lead threading can now be
simulated, with decreasing lead threading containing a check for a
feed reduction to zero (error diagnostic 0170004).</p></li>
<li><p>Other Virtual Machine enhancements:</p></li>
<li><p>Loading time at the start of processing has been quickened where
possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Before selecting Run»Play to begin processing, if a simulation option
is changed that requires a restart, the Run»Restart menu option and
tool-bar button are now made selectable. [V21‑1738, V22‑1738]</p></li>
<li><p>A restart is no longer necessary when modifying tooling definitions
or when making changes to the design part, in-process stock and/or
fixtures. Changes made are effective going forward.</p></li>
<li><p>3D solid objects must be “water-tight” when used for material removal
simulation. Testing and healing these objects can take considerable
time. A new warning diagnostic 01700003 will be output identifying
objects that requires healing. New fatal diagnostic 01700001 will be
output identifying objects that cannot be healed.</p></li>
<li><p>Other diagnostics have been added to indicate when an unrecoverable
error has occurred (01700000) or when material removal simulation has
failed (01700002). These errors cause a more graceful exit of the
process and may help in identifying the problem when reporting the
issue to ICAM Support.</p></li>
<li><p>Vericut PLY files (a type of STL) are now supported for all Mesh
import functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Very large STL files (over 2 Gb) are now supported (but not
recommended).</p></li>
<li><p>In-process stock marked for automatic export at the end of processing
will no longer be exported when the process is restarted or exited
before it has come to completion.</p></li>
<li><p>The individual columns of the Simulation»Tools/Holders/Heads dialog
are sortable.</p></li>
<li><p>Generic milling tools now have both rotating (i.e., spun) and
non-rotating representations during simulation. This enables oriented
boring cycles to be accurately simulated. This also enables full
support for indexable end-mills.</p></li>
<li><p>To speed processing, Virtual Machine caches spun copies of tooling
and other data in a temporary folder on the computer. This folder can
be cleared, if necessary, using the Config utility “Clear cache
folder” button. [V21‑1711, V22‑1711]</p></li>

second or two when starting in Full or Progress mode. This dialog
lists the steps remaining before processing can start (e.g., loading
the model, loading the fixtures, et cetera) and identifies the time
it took for each step to complete. This can help identify problematic
simulation components, such as those that require healing or that
contain too much detail. The appearance of this dialog can be

<li><p>Debugging enhancements:</p></li>
<li><p>A new “Jump to cursor” (Ctrl+Shift+F10) context menu selection in the

debugging purposes, allowing the same input (i.e., cldata with Gener;
MCD with CeRun) to be processed again, or allowing input to be

check-box is selected in the Breakpoint Manager.</p></li>
<li><p>Debugging of multi-channel processes in CeRun has been improved.
Start of processing initialization is now done on a channel by
channel basis instead of all at the same time. More enhancements are

<li><p>CATIA V5-6R2016 and later CAM integration will now attempt to find a
more recent version of the post-processor <em>name.version</em> saved with
the CATProcess, if the saved name and version combination no longer

<li><p>Unigraphics NX6 − 12</p></li>
<li><p>Manufacturing Extractors have been enhanced as follows:</p></li>
<li><p>New preference options better control Extractor behavior:</p></li>
<li><p>The “<em>Save/Restore last setup</em>” option when selected will
remember the choices made in the extractor for the current session
and apply them the next time the extractor is run for the same
process. Settings are stored in a <em>status.xml</em> file in the working
folder.</p></li>
<li><p>The “<em>Use settings from previous extraction</em>” option will merge
the previous Virtual Machine VSW file contents with the newly created
one, so as to preserve custom viewpoints, lighting, current view and
other user interface settings.</p></li>
<li><p>The “<em>Use common tolerance settings</em>” option when selected will
use a common set of tolerance values (Gouge, Collision, Facet…)
regardless of the Virtual Machine model being used. Previously,
separate tolerances were remembered on a model by model basis.</p></li>
<li><p>The “<em>Use tool number as offset number</em>” option when selected
will ignore the CAM system tool length compensation settings and
force them to be the same as the tool number.</p></li>
<li><p>The “<em>Use external tool library</em>” option when selected will by
default use tool definitions from the selected tool library in place
of the tool geometry definition from the CAM system. ICAM tool
libraries in VSW format and Vericut tool libraries in TLS format are
supported. The geometry source for individual tools is identified
using color coding; the source can be overridden on an individual
tool basis to use the CAM geometry, the default library geometry, or
a selected tool in a selected library.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple setup improvements for in-process stock allow the NC
programmer to specify the flow of processing of one or more stock
objects through multiple setups and/or NC programs. A single stock
object can spawn multiple stock objects in later setups/programs, and
vice versa. Selecting a stock object in the Extractor will highlight
associated stock objects in other setups/programs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple setup has also been improved to support
dual-turret/dual-spindle type machines. Each setup can now clearly
indicate the turrets and/or spindles in use for that particular setup.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>New trace tabs are available to trace the extraction of components
from the CAM system and to trace the generation of data needed for
Virtual Machine simulation. New buttons are available to cancel the
extraction if necessary, and to restart the extractor following
changes to the CAM process.</p></li>
<li><p>A number of tooling related enhancements have been made:</p></li>

<li><p>NX Library Tool, Solid Tool and Probing Tool types are now supported.</p></li>
<li><p>An “Unused tool” group lists tools defined in the CAM process but not
used in any tool-path.</p></li>
<li><p>A Vericut vcProject file can be dropped onto an extractor to use the
tools, parts, stock and fixtures defined in the Vericut project file
instead of those from the CAM system. A standalone Vericut extractor
is also available to process Vericut project files with CeRun.</p></li>
<li><p>Aptsource / CLDATA enhancements:</p></li>
<li><p>The PowerMill DUCT5 CAM interface was enhanced to support the
following DEF file option settings: [V22‑1720]</p></li>
<li><p>RAPID_FEED can be set to “YES” to have DUCT5 “rapid_feed” motions
prefixed with a RAPID command. The default is “NO”, which outputs a
high FEDRAT value in place of RAPID commands.</p></li>
<li><p>SKIM_FEED can be set to “YES” to have DUCT5 “skim_feed” motions
prefixed with a RAPID command. The default is “NO”, which outputs a
high FEDRAT value in place of RAPID commands.</p></li>
<li><p>USE_ISN can be set to “YES” to output special DUCT5 CLDATA records
with a class code greater than 15000 as #1017:<em>n</em> ISN records (where
<em>n</em> is computed as the DUCT5 class code plus the subclass code). This
allows these records to be hidden in the Gener Source window if
desired, simplifying debugging.</p></li>
<li><p>The Mastercam CAM interface was enhanced to support the APlus v2.2 LC
and WA commands for additive machining. These commands are passed
as-is to Gener, with LC using Major code #2000:1904 and WA using
Major code #2000:1905. The interface kit has dummy macros to catch
and ignore these commands if post-processor user-defined macros have
not been written to process them. [V22‑1749]</p></li>

<p>An INCLUD/'<em>filename</em>' command makes the macro processor aware of user
function macros stored in an external file (the default path is
$icam_appdata\macro). An INCLUD command defining the function must be

of date and time. For example, $FDATE('%Y.%m.%d') returns the current
date in numeric YYYY.MM.DD format.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$FERSEV(</strong><em>errnum *[,*severity</em>]<strong>)</strong> function now
accepts an optional second argument, which is the new severity level

<li><p>A new <strong>$FMXTYPE(</strong><em>matrix *[,*type</em>]<strong>)</strong> function returns a
numeric value that identifies the transformation type of the

<li><p>A new <strong>$FTMPFILE(</strong>[<em>file</em>]<strong>)</strong> function creates a temporary
file in the Windows TMP directory returning a string containing the
absolute path and name of the temporary file. If an optional <em>file</em>
is specified, then a copy of the specified file is created in the TMP
directory instead of an empty file. Use the ‘//ICAMFS/” universal
file descriptor to obtain a temporary copy of a file in the internal
file storage area. Temporary files are automatically deleted when the
process ends.</p></li>
<li><p>Virtual Machine functions:</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$FMSADPT</strong> function can now also be used by CeRun to
enable/disable the reporting of collisions. CeRun however cannot
avoid collisions (as Gener can).</p></li>
<li><p>A new <strong>$FMSGPOSJ</strong> function can be used to get the current joint
position of any model axis identified either by its component ID
(from $FMSID) or kernel axis number or name. Similarly, a new
<strong>$FMSGPOSW</strong> function returns the WCS (work coordinate system) value
of the specified axis.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$FMSIDT</strong> function can now be called with “TOOL,<em>id</em>” to
return the type of the specified tool component id (i.e., 1:holder,
2:body…). This functionality was developed so that collision testing
of specific tool components could be deactivated via the $FMSVCL
function if necessary. [V22-1748]</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A new <strong>$FMSLIMIT</strong> function can be used to query or customize the
travel limit range of any linear or rotary axis define in the model.
This can be used, for example, to temporarily inhibit travel checking
when simulating a tool change, or to shrink the available travel for
SmartPATH or other considerations. [V22-1751]</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$FMSMSP</strong> function now accepts an optional TURN-MILL parameter,
which can be used to define in advance the controlling spindle for
turning and milling operations on a mill-turn machine. This function
can now be used by CeRun when running the control emulator integrated
with Dassault Systèmes DELMIA machine simulation.</p></li>
<li><p>A new <strong>$FMSUPDPOS</strong> function can be used to update the kernel
${XYZABC}M machine and ${XYZ}W workpiece system variable values to
match the current Virtual Machine axes positions, which takes tool
and workpiece compensations as well as $FMSMOVE commands into
account.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$FMSVCL</strong> function accepts a new LOCK-AUTO parameter, which if
set to LOCK will inhibit any further activation or deactivation of
collision testing on the specified component except via future calls
to $FMSVCL or by SmartPATH. AUTO is the default and enables internal
changes to tool collision states as necessary. [V22-1748]</p></li>

<h3>Macro Variables<a class="headerlink" href="#macro-variables" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The following new variables are available with both Gener and CeRun:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$ASSVMNAM</strong> is a string variable listing the name of the associated
Virtual Machine model. The string is blank if there is no associated
model.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$AXESC2P</strong> is a read-only string variable in $AXES format that
indicates the machine axes that are being controlled by polar
interpolation. It is blank when polar interpolation is not active.
$OE and $INFO read-write variants of this variable are also available
in Gener.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$CHSIZ</strong> is a read-only variable that indicates the total number of
kernel channels, which is equal to the number of composite control
emulator components, or 2 for a merging lathe and 1 for all other
machine types. <strong>$CI</strong> is a read-only variable that indicates current
kernel channel number. [V22‑1738]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$DIAGLIST</strong> is a settable sequence variable that lists all
diagnostics (by number) that have occurred since the start of
processing, or since last cleared. This variable can also be used
during Gener $FLOOK and $FINFO look-ahead processing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$EV</strong> indicates the variable thread lead ($E already returns the
thread lead). Thread <em>lead</em> values are calculating as thread <em>pitch</em>
values times the number of thread starts. I.e., $E=$PITCH*$MULTRD and
$EV=$PITCHV*$MULTRD. $OE and $INFO read-write variants of this
variable are also available in Gener.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$FOI</strong> identifies the first operation index ($OI) following the
last tool change. This variable is initialized to zero at the start
of processing and is reset to zero at each tool change. It is
automatically set to the current operation index ($OI) on an
operation change. It is also settable in a macro.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$LCSMTN</strong> is a settable variable that indicates if and how LCS
affects the rotary axes of the machine when LCS is activated. If the
value is −1, then LCS is not capable of moving rotary axes and
setting this variable to any other value will result in a diagnostic.
Otherwise, this variable can be set to indicate no motion,
rotary-only motion, or RTCP rotary motion about the tool tip.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$LCSORD</strong> is a read-only variable that identifies the contents of
the $LCSROT sequence variable, which indicates the LCS rotation
parameters. It will be the string “IJK” if LCS rotation is defined
about a vector, otherwise it will be a 2 or 3-character string “xxx”
where each character “x” in the string will be one of the letters A,
B or C representing rotation about the X, Y or Z axes respectively.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$PITCH</strong> indicates the thread pitch ($PITCHV already indicates
variable thread pitch). $OE and $INFO read-write variants of this
variable are also available in Gener.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$PSE</strong> is a read-only logical variable that is set true when
running combined post-processing, simulation and control emulation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$TH*</strong> thread cycle variables are now read-write, with the
exception of those listed below. This enables macro processing to set
threading parameters if necessary.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>$THTYPE is not settable. Gener does not allow the $THCUTS, $THDPTH and
$THSTEP variables to be set, since these are derived from a thread
stepping table created used the THREAD command STEP and DEPTH parameters
(these variables are settable in CeRun).</p>
<p>A new <strong>$THCHFT</strong> “thread chamfer type” variable indicates if and how
the thread chamfer was defined. Values are 0 if a chamfer is not
defined, 1 for CHAMFR and 2 for ATANGL (Gener only). The $THCHFA and
$THCHFL variables return the length and angle as defined by the chamfer
definition type.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The following variables, previously only available with Gener, are
now also available with CeRun:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$E</strong> defines the thread lead.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$PITCHV</strong> defines the thread variable pitch.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$SHEAD</strong> defines the controlling spindle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$SUBNAM</strong> is a string containing the current sub-program name.</p></li>
<li><p>Gener variables:</p></li>
<li><p>There is a new concept of “joint” axis, to represent the Gener kernel
machine axes after taking LIMIT/LENGTH tool compensation and
LIMIT/ADJUST workpiece compensation into account. The following
<strong>$…J</strong> joint variables are available:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$[NL]{XYZUVWE}J</strong> linear axes joint positions</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$[NL]{ABC}[TH]J</strong> rotary axes joint positions</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$[NL]{ND}J</strong> nutating axes joint positions</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$AIRCUT</strong> is a read-only logical variable that is set true when
SmartCUT is active.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$AXESMCD</strong> is a string variable in $AXES format that indicates the
axes that have been output to the MCD since the last tool change.
This variable is initialized to blank at the start of post-processing
and is reset to blank at each tool change. It is also settable in a
macro. It can be used to test if an axis has been output to tape
since the last tool change or custom event.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$CUTTER</strong> is a read-only sequence variable of length 7 or 10 that
contains the APT standard cutter definition from the last CUTTER
command.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$FEDOPT</strong> is a read-only logical variable that is set true when
SmartFEED is active.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$FITMAXPTS</strong> is a numeric variable that sets an upper limit on the
number of motions that can be considered for inclusion into a single
arc or NURBS during fitting. The default continues to be 5,000, but
can be set to any limit, including “0” which means unlimited.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$GOTOCLN</strong> is a numeric variable that is set to the current CLN
each time a motion is processed. This variable is initialized to zero
at the start of post-processing and is reset to zero at each tool
change. It is also settable in a macro. It can be used to test if a
motion has been processed since the last tool change or custom event.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$INFO.OPCNT</strong> is a read-only numeric variable that is set to the
number of transitions from positioning to cutting that occurred in
the cldata range scanned by the last $FINFO function call.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$INFO.ISMSR</strong> is a logical variable that is set true when there are
multiple operations in the cldata range scanned by the last $FINFO
function call (see $INFO.OPCNT above) and they don't all start with
an identical rotary position.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$LCAMOD</strong> is a numeric variable that indicates the LCS/AUTO mode. A
new mode 0 is now supported, which uses separate <strong>$LCAON</strong> and
$<strong>LCAOFF</strong> variables to specify the conditions for automatic LCS
activation and deactivation. The various possibilities are listed
under the LCS/AUTO command on page 10.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$LIMADJ</strong> is a read-only numeric sequence variable that indicates
the fixture compensation <em>xyz</em> offsets as defined using the new
LIMIT/ADJUST command.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$LIMLEN</strong> is a read-only numeric sequence variable that indicates
the length compensation <em>xyz</em> offsets as defined using the new
LIMIT/LENGTH command.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$LINTOL</strong> is a logical variable that indicates and can change the
LINTOL/ON-OFF state.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$ORIGIN</strong> and <strong>$ORIGINL</strong> are read-only sequence variables that
contain the current ORIGIN and ORIGIN/LAST command matrices. $OE and
$INFO read-write variants of these variables are also available.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$SCTLOOK</strong> is a read-only logical variable that is set true during
SmartCUT and SmartFEED look-ahead.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$SCTLRNG</strong> is a numeric variable that can limit the number of
continuous feed motions analyzed during each SmartCUT and SmartFEED
look-ahead. By default, each look-ahead can process up to 10,000 feed
motions. This can be set to as few as 100 (for better responsiveness
at the expense of longer processing time) or as many as 50,000 (for
poorer responsiveness but shorter processing).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$TLMERGE</strong> is a logical variable that can be set false to cause
repeated loads of the same tool to each occupy their own $TLTAB row.
This variable is true by default, which results in one row in $TLTAB
per tool, no matter how many times loaded.</p></li>
<li><p>Motion variables have been enhanced to simplify macro development
with merging lathes:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$N*</strong> next motion variable processing now returns the next motion
for the <em>current</em> turret. Previously, the next motion in the cldata
was returned without regard to merging lathe HEAD processing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>${XYZ}*</strong> macro variables can now be used when the SIDE turret is
active on a merging lathe. Previously, ${UVW}* variables were
required to be used when referencing the SIDE turret X, Y and Z axes.
Either can now be used)</p></li>
<li><p>CeRun variables:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$ASSPPNAM</strong> is a string variable listing the name of the associated
post-processor. The string is blank if there is no associated
post-processor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$PREPROC</strong> is string variable listing the name of the associated
pre-processor. The string is blank if a pre-processor is not being
used.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$SUBSTK</strong> is a read-only sequence of strings, listing the
sub-programs on the CNC program stack. The sequence is empty when
processing the main program.</p></li>
<li><p>Virtual Machine variables:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$VMDRAW</strong> is a logical variable that when set false inhibits
updating of the Simulation window, except when paused or at the end
of processing. Temporarily set $VMDRAW false to speed processing when
performing many $FMS function calls in a macro. [V22-1728]</p></li>

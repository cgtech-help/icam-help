<p>ICAM software is not available for UNIX systems. An ICAM database
created with V20 or earlier on a UNIX system is fully compatible with
ICAM software running on Windows systems.</p>
<p>ICAM V24 can run under Microsoft Windows 7 and 8, and Microsoft Windows
Server 2008R2, but these operating systems are no longer supported by
Microsoft.</p>
<p>** V24 is the final version supporting 32-bit architectures. The
32-bit installers are available with V24 on demand only. Contact
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:support&#37;&#52;&#48;icam&#46;com">support<span>&#64;</span>icam<span>&#46;</span>com</a> should you require a 32-bit installation. Note that
there is no performance benefit to using 32-bit, but there is a
disadvantage with 32-bit of having less available memory for a running
process.</p>

<h3>Licensing<a class="headerlink" href="#licensing" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When used with floating licenses, the ICAM License Manager (ICAMLM)
now has the ability to list and manage the client computers that are
entitled to check out licenses. For example, a 1/5 license permits up
to 5 different computers to share 1 concurrent use of the license.
Once 5 different computers have used the license, further requests
from any computer not on that list will be refused. The ICAMLM now
provides the ability to remove client computers from the list,
freeing up the space for other computers. Client computers that are
removed from the list are refused access for a period of 48 hours. A
password can be set to restrict the ability to remove client
computers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image113.png"><img alt="image1" src="../../_images/image113.png" style="width: 5.1956in; height: 2.43in;" /></a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>ICAM can now host your floating licenses on a cloud server. With
cloud licensing, you can run ICAM software from home, at work, or
anywhere there is an Internet connection. ICAM maintains both the
server and your licenses. The ICAM.KEY file on the client computer
contains the information as usual that identifies the cloud server
URL and port, with an additional unique identifier for security
purposes.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><p>005 35.238.180.21:6700 632ef8b8-675a-404b-81b0-53e633f246ff</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Cloud licenses are identical to floating licenses, with the advantage
that they can be accessed from anywhere. Client computer count
limitations are still in effect, and these can be managed from the ICAM
License Manager (ICAMLM) from any computer where ICAM software is
installed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image26.png"><img alt="image2" src="../../_images/image26.png" style="width: 2.56944in; height: 1.56944in;" /></a>A message box will now appear notifying of soon-to-expire
licenses. This message box will appear once when reaching 30 days
from expiry, once again when 15 days from expiry, and once each day
during the last week before expiry.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>icamflm.key</em> floating license key-file has been renamed
<em>icamls.key</em>, to better reflect the fact that this key-file is used
by the ICAM License Server (ICAMLS). The key-file contents have been
encrypted for better protection against tampering, but still include
the original plaintext description of the key-file contents for
readability purposes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The old floating license key-file previously resided in the <em>Program
Files</em> license server installation directory, but it is now located in
the <em>ProgramData\ICAM\Server</em> directory. This will make key-file
updates easier since <em>Program Data</em> is generally writable while <em>Program
Files</em> is not.</p>
<p>To simplify upgrading, the version number has been removed from the
License Server installation and data directory names. The same version
numbering is used for the licensing installation software as for the
main product (i.e., 240).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The ICAM License Server <em>icamls.log</em> file is now located in the
<em>ProgramData\‌ICAM\‌Server</em> directory instead of the <em>Program Files</em>
license server installation directory.</p></li>
<li><p>The ICAM License Manager (ICAMLM) and ICAMID Utility <em>Network Test</em>
functionality now use TCP communication to access the ICAM License
Server. Previously they used UDP communication, which when used
outside of a local area network (LAN) generally required routing
rules to be added to network equipment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that ICMP is still used by the ICAMID Utility <em>Network Test</em> and
the License Server license checkout functions. ICMP <em>must</em> be enabled on
the client computer in order for the network hop count to be checked.
ICMP is not required for cloud licensing.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>V24 license check-out has been sped up considerably, which is
especially noticeable with multi-hop licenses.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="configuration">
<h3>Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The Config utility has been simplified to remove the Open, Save In,
Save As and Save buttons. These were used in V23 and older versions
to open configuration files from various locations and then to save
them to the same or different locations. This caused confusion since
these changes would have no effect if the ICAM.DEF file being saved
was not the one actually in use.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image33.png"><img alt="image3" src="../../_images/image33.png" style="width: 4.33in; height: 4.36654in;" /></a></p>
<p>The Config utility now simply shows the path and name of the ICAM.DEF
configuration file that was found (or that will be created) by the
Config utility, and by extension, all other ICAM software. Selecting OK
saves any changes and exits; selecting Cancel ignores changes and exits.</p>

<h3>Quest Developer’s<a class="headerlink" href="#quest-developers" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The questionnaire has been enhanced with new and modified questions,
as follows.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>General Description / General Information</em> section question #70
“Primary machine unit system” now takes its default response from the
ICAM.DEF definition file UNITS symbol. [V23.0‑1930]</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>General Description / General Information</em> section has a new
question #6.7 “Update WCS position from VM simulation [Yes,No]” that
is asked for control emulators only. When answered “Yes” (the default
for new CE’s), the CeRun motion kernel will be updated with the
current Virtual Machine coordinates each time there is a change in
compensation. This is particularly important for programs using G91
incremental motions. CE’s created with older versions will have a
“No” response for this question, to maintain compatibility. ICAM
recommends this question be answered “Yes”.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Machine Description / Register</em> section now also lists the usage
for disabled registers. Previously, disabling a register would cause
the <em>Uses</em> column to be empty, giving the false impression that the
register was both disabled and unused.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The right-mouse context menu when selecting a single register in the
register table now includes new “Go to” menu selections listing each of
the uses of that register. Choosing a usage causes Quest to jump
directly to the questionnaire section and question that defined that
particular use of the register.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <em>Control Description / Coordinate System</em> section question #37
“LCS enables RTCP” has a new “Convert” option that can be specified
for machines with rotary tables.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Control Description / Coordinate System</em> section also has a new
question #49.6 “Rotation angle convention” that provides control over
how LCS command rotation angles are output to the MCD.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Control Description / Coordinate System</em> section has three new
questions #94, #94.1 and #94.2 that define the default LCS/AUTO
format to use if not explicitly given in the LCS command or via the
$LCAMOD variable. [V23.0‑1903]</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Two additional questions #94.3 and #94.4 define how the UW axes of the
automatic LCS frame should be oriented, and if the automatic LCS should
include a translation component. These settings can also be controlled
in Gener using $LCAUTO and $LCAUTOT macro variables.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <em>Control Description / Tool and Fixture Compensation</em> section has
new tool length compensation questions that can be used to support
G43.4 and G43.5 codes on a Fanuc controller, or on any CNC where
length compensation is a form of RTCP. Not counting basic G43 length
compensation, up to three additional tool compensation codes can be
supported. For each code, Quest asks:</p></li>
<li><p>The (G) code that activates the tool compensation (e.g., 43.4, 43.5,
43.1…)</p></li>
<li><p>The RTCP setting that is used by the CNC when this code is active. Up
to two different RTCP settings can now be defined (see
<em>Advanced 5D Machining</em> below).</p></li>
<li><p>The RTCP rotary axis control format (e.g., Rotary axes, Vectors,
Euler…)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The compensation type can be specified in Gener using a new TLVEC,#
parameter on the CUTCOM/ON,LENGTH command, or via a new $TCLSET macro
variable.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <em>Control Description / Tool and Fixture Compensation</em> section has
a new diameter compensation question #262 “Behavior at start and end”
that describes the entry and exit compensation choices that are known
to be available. The response to this question is used by Virtual
Machine to more accurately simulate compensated tool paths.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Control Description / Tool and Fixture Compensation</em> section
question #360 “Rotary table continuous fixture compensation” has a
new “RTCP” response, that supports machines that continuously adjust
the coordinates when the table rotates, but only when RTCP is active.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Control Description / Tool and Fixture Compensation</em> section
also has a new fixture compensation question #370 “Rotary table
dynamic fixture compensation” that supports non-modal adjustment of
the fixture compensation based on the current rotary table position,
such as can be found with the G254/G255 codes on a HAAS CNC. This
form of compensation is used for rotary positioning only. Additional
questions ask for the enable and disable (G) codes. This
functionality is controlled in Gener using a new CUTCOM/TABLE,ON-OFF
command, and can also be controlled from Gener and CeRun using a new
$DYNFIX macro variable.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Control Description / Advanced 5D Machining</em> section has a new
question #100.05 “Number of RTCP settings” that enables multiple RTCP
settings to be defined. For this release, possible choices are 1 (the
default) or 2. On a Siemens CNC for example, this could be used to
define separate TRAORI(1) and TRAORI(2) functionality. On a Fanuc CNC
this could be used to define the RTCP behavior of the G43.4 and G43.5
tool length compensation codes. For each setting, Quest asks:</p></li>
<li><p>The (G) code that activates the RTCP setting</p></li>
<li><p>The RTCP interpolation and positioning strategies (e.g., NA, TTO,
Thru…)</p></li>
<li><p>If the CNC compensates for the part position due to table rotation</p></li>
<li><p>If the CNC also compensates for the part orientation due to table
rotation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The RTCP type can be specified in Gener using a new # parameter on the
MODE/TLVEC command, or via a new $TCPSET macro variable.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <em>Optional PP Words / CALSUB</em> section has a new question #4.1
“Subprogram file extension name” that defines the tape file extension
for subprograms that are written to separate files (the default is
“.tps”). A read/write $SUBEXT system variable provides macro access
to the same information.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Optional PP Words / SEQNO</em> section now always asks question #5
“Minimum value” regardless of the Register section “Use default
resolution/‌minimum/‌maximum values” check-box setting. This allows
sequence numbers to start at zero or negative values. [V23.0‑1928]</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Customization</em> section has been enhanced for post-processor
development as follows:</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Startup/Shutdown Procedures</em> RMD (Rapid Macro Development)
editor has a new “Convert to Custom macro” icon on the icon bar (see
below), which can be used to change selected built-in RMD actions in
the Macro list to a “Custom macro” type so that the macro code of the
RMD action can be edited.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image114.png"><img alt="image11" src="../../_images/image114.png" style="width: 3.70787in; height: 0.42703in;" /></a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <em>LCS Startup</em> macro now includes a new “SIEMENS CYCLE800” RMD
action, which outputs a CYCLE800 subprogram call instead of
combinations of TRANS and ROT commands. This RMD macro prompts for
the rotary axis, if any, that affects the “DIR” parameter of the
cycle. If a rotary axis is specified, the sign of that axis will be
used for the DIR parameter and Gener will assume that the CYCLE800
causes the rotary axes to position.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Cycle Startup</em> macro &quot;SIEMENS drilling cycles&quot; RMD action was
using MCALL modal cycles only when there were two or more consecutive
points in the cycle block; it now uses the MCALL format regardless of
the number of points. If required, set $IAGCYC(12)=<em>n</em> to specify
the minimum number of consecutive points “n” required to use the
modal MCALL format.</p></li>
<li><p>Setting $P1=–2 in a <em>Cycle Startup</em> macro will only perform the feed
rate processing portion of the cycle output when OUTPUT is next
called. This can be used to force feed information out in a block
separate from other cycle output. [V23.0‑1904]</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">%L01=$P1</div>
<div class="line">$P1=-2</div>
<div class="line">OUTPUT $$ feed rate output here</div>
<div class="line">…</div>
<div class="line">$P1=%L01</div>
<div class="line">OUTPUT $$ remainder of cycle output here</div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The “Display current mach. time” RMD action was updated to use time
output format codes in the DISPLY command. Previously, formulas in
the RMD macros were used to convert the time value to hours, minutes
and seconds. Also, the “Set internal axis position” RMD action now
uses the MOVETO/MANUAL command instead of CLAMP/MANUAL,OFF. The
result is the same, but MOVETO is the preferred way of moving axes.
These changes only affect new instances of these RMD actions; current
post-processors are not affected.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Register Macro</em> now includes a new $P5 variable that identifies
the CODE or DATA identifier of the register being formatted, and the
$REGMATCH system variable now supports CODE and DATA identifiers.
This provides fine-tuned control over when the Register macro is
called, and simplifies the coding of register macros since it is now
possible to differentiate between different functions that share the
same register.</p></li>
<li><p>Other Quest enhancements:</p></li>
<li><p>When restarting Quest with the previously saved environment restored,
the most recent revision of the post-processors, control emulators
and models will be loaded into memory, regardless of what actual
revisions were being edited the last time Quest was run. This will
prevent mistakenly working on older revisions. [V23.0‑2005]</p></li>
<li><p>Dragging and dropping a packaged job (.zpj) file onto a running Quest
application will temporarily add the packaged job databases to the
Database navigator window. They will remain there for the current
Quest session only. [V23.0‑1933]</p></li>
<li><p>The Quest <em>Tools»Finder…</em> utility (ctrl+shift+f) now has a “Macro
comments” check-box that when cleared will inhibit the searching of
text in macro comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The Quest <em>Tools»Calculator…</em> has been enhanced to use the regular
keyboard functions in addition to those of the numeric keypad.</p></li>
<li><p>The Quest application title bar now shows the product version and mod
level. The <em>Help»About Quest…</em> menu now shows the version, mod level
and build number. The build number helps Support technicians identify
the exact release you are running, which can be helpful when
resolving technical issues.</p></li>
<li><p>A new <em>Help»Documentation…</em> menu opens Windows File Explorer showing
all ICAM documentation installed with the V24 release. These are in a
“documentation” sub-folder of the V24 installation.</p></li>
<li><p>The Quest application status bar shows the interface kit that is
being used for Major and Minor word definitions in the macro
processor. Clicking on the current kit name will open a selection
window listing all available interface kits. Selecting a kit from the
list will use that kit’s Major/Minor words for macro processing. The
kit selection is remembered from one run of Quest to the next. This
does not affect the default kit selection in the launch panel.</p></li>

solely on cutting tool-paths, leaving the connecting positioning
tool-paths to be automatically generated by SmartPATH; long entry,
exit and non-cutting feed motions to be minimized by SmartCUT; and
cutting feed rates to be optimized by SmartFEED. These three modules
are collectively known as SmartPACK. They have been continually
improved and fine-tuned.</p></li>
<li><p>SmartPATH by default recalculates positioning motions above the cycle
CLEAR (i.e., entry clearance) plane. A new
<strong>SMARTP/CYCLE,CLEAR-RETURN</strong> command can be specified to tell
SmartPATH to recalculate positioning motions either above the CLEAR
or the RETURN (i.e., exit clearance) planes. [V22.0‑1918, V23.0‑1918]</p></li>
<li><p>SmartPATH now recognizes when angled tool holders are in use and
applies the retract safety as much as possible along the angled tool
direction instead of along the spindle axis direction. This produces
much better results when working in recessed cavities with angled
tool holders. [V23.0‑1944]</p></li>
<li><p>SmartPATH now does additional testing when connecting the end of one
operation to the start of the next, in an attempt to find a linking
motion with better “squareness”. The new operation linking motions
have the same or better time cost, and with greater visual appeal to
the machine operator.</p></li>
<li><p>Post-processor commands have been enhanced to provide new
functionality as follows:</p></li>
<li><p>A new <strong>ADAPTV/NORMAL</strong> command modal option can be used to enable
Virtual Machine simulation during normal processing, while
automatically disabling it during $FLOOK and $FINFO look-ahead
processing. This will speed up look-ahead processing when running
adaptive post-processing. [V23.0‑1929]</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>CUTCOM/ON,LENGTH</strong> command has a new “RTCP,<em>n</em>” option to
specify the length compensation mode <em>n</em> to use on machines with
multiple tool compensation settings. A new diagnostic #1302068 is
output if the selected mode is not available.</p></li>
<li><p>A new <strong>CUTCOM/TABLE,ON-OFF</strong> command is available to enable and
disable rotary table dynamic fixture compensation. This is a form of
rotary table workpiece compensation used for 5-axis positioning only.
It can also be controlled from Gener and CeRun using a new $DYNFIX
macro variable. A new diagnostic #1302069 is output when attempting
to activate this feature on a machine that does not support it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CYCLE/DEEP</strong> and <strong>CYCLE/BRKCHP</strong> now support a new
“MINSTP,<em>value</em>” couplet that defines the minimum cycle step
distance ($CYMIN variable) for a constantly decreasing deep or chip
breaking cycle. [V23.0‑1944]</p></li>
<li><p>To simplify the <strong>LIMIT</strong> command syntax, LIMIT/RANGE and
LIMIT/ORIENT should now be used in place of “LIMIT/ORIENT,ABSOL” and
“LIMIT/ORIENT,INCR”. The old syntax will continue to work, but it
will not be documented. [V23.0‑1947]</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>LINTOL</strong> command has been modified to support the use of a new
RTCP minor keyword in place of TLVEC. The TLVEC keyword will continue
to be supported, but not documented.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>MCHTOL</strong> command has a new “OPTION,3,<em>eaccel</em>,<em>toler</em>”
setting that specifies HSM acceleration as a fraction of Earth
acceleration. This can be used as an alternative to the
“OPTION,1,<em>feed</em>,<em>time</em>,<em>toler</em>” acceleration
setting. [V22.0‑1908, V23.0‑1908]</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>MODE</strong> command has been enhanced as follows:</p></li>
<li><p>RTCP control now uses MODE/RTCP instead of MODE/TLVEC. The TLVEC
keyword will continue to be supported, but not documented.</p></li>
<li><p>For machines with multiple RTCP settings, the setting number <em>n</em> is
specified using the “RTCP,<em>n</em>” option. A new diagnostic #1372007
is output if the selected mode is not available.</p></li>
<li><p>For 6-axis shared linear axis processing, the MODE/EXPAND,PROTCT
distance calculations now take the LIMIT/LENGTH and LIMIT/ADJUST
settings into account. Having Gener account for the expected tool
length and fixture compensation amounts when testing for shared axis
travel results in a more optimal solution. [V23.0‑1938]</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>ORIGIN</strong> command matrix syntax has been enhanced to define a
center of rotation via a new “AT,<em>xc</em>,<em>yc</em>[,<em>zc</em>]”
option, as well as to define a translation with respect to the
as-rotated frame via a new “TRANS,<em>x2</em>,<em>y2</em>[,<em>z2</em>]”
option.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image123.png"><img alt="image12" src="../../_images/image123.png" style="height: 90px;" /></a></p>
<p>The same functionality applies to the INDEX, LCS, LIMIT, MSYS, and PLOT
commands, as well as to the $FMX macro function.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>SAFETY</strong> motion splitting command has been enhanced to control
where, in a multi-block split motion, codes for RTCP, LCS and length
compensation are to be output. These functions can be combined with
individual axes motions or output alone on a block.</p></li>
<li><p>“RTCP,#-ON-OFF” defines where RTCP is to be changed</p></li>
<li><p>“LCS,ON-OFF” defines where LCS is to be changed</p></li>
<li><p>“LENGTH,#-ON-OFF” defines where tool length comp is to be changed</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The keyword REV can be used as a substitute for all active rotary axes.
The keyword LINEAR can be used as a substitute for all active linear
axes. The keyword ALL can be used to output all active axes. Follow any
individual or axis group keyword with NOW to output the current (i.e.,
before split) position of the axes instead of the target position.</p>
<p>The entire split motion block is output using the current FEDRAT or
RAPID in effect. This can be changed on an individual split motion basis
by adding RAPID or “FEED,<em>value</em>[,<em>units</em>]” to force a positioning
velocity.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>SPINDL</strong> command has been enhanced as follows:</p></li>
<li><p>To simplify programming, either “MAXRPM,0” or “MAXRPM,OFF”.can now be
used to remove the CSS maximum spindle speed limitation. [V23.0‑2036]</p></li>
<li><p>To simplify CSS emulation “STEP,0” and STEP,OFF can both be used to
disable constant surface speed emulation. “INCR,<em>Δrpm</em>” can be
used as an alternative to “STEP,<em>n</em>”, to define CSS emulation in
terms of change in RPM instead of gear range
subdivisions. [V23.0‑2036]</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>THREAD</strong> command has been enhanced as follows:</p></li>
<li><p>To simplify programming, either “ATANGL,0,0” or “CHAMFR,0,0” can be
specified to indicate that a chamfer is not required. [V23.0‑1905]</p></li>
<li><p>A new “MINSTP,<em>value</em>” couplet defines the minimum threading step
distance ($THMIN variable) for a thread where the step distance is
based on constant cross section of cut. [V23.0‑1944]</p></li>
<li><p>Other Gener enhancements:</p></li>
<li><p>3D tool compensation (i.e., CUTCOM/NORMAL command) is now available
for 3-axis milling machines. Previously, this was only available for
milling machines with at least one rotary axis. [V22.0‑1918,
V23.0‑1918]</p></li>
<li><p>When <em>Control Description / Tool and Fixture Compensation</em> section
question #251 “Can diameter comp. be applied with RAPID positioning”
is answered “No”, new warning diagnostics #01302070 and #01302071 are
now output when Gener converts positioning motions to high feed at
the start and end of a diameter compensated tool path. [V23.0‑2150]</p></li>
<li><p>Linearization (i.e., LINTOL command) processing now detects when the
specified linearization tolerance is too fine to be supported on the
machine. A new warning diagnostic #1426009 lists both the requested
and actual tolerance values.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Linearization cannot be applied if the distance between the rotary pivot
and the tool tip is zero. This condition is now signaled with a new
warning diagnostic #1426010. The problem can be solved by including the
head rotary pivot amounts in the post-processor definition and/or by
defining a tool length via the LINTOL/LENGTH command. [V22.0‑1925,
V23.0‑1925]</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Gener now outputs diagnostic #1429001 when a pending deferred coolant
activation is replaced with a different type. There is no change in
tape output; just a warning to indicate why the original deferred
coolant code was not output. [V23.0‑2106]</p></li>
<li><p>The number of unique subprograms that can be defined in a program
(i.e., DEFSUB command) has been increased from 200 to
500. [V22.0‑1948, V23.0‑1948]</p></li>
<li><p>The number of operations that can be tracked in a program (i.e.,
OPTYPE command) has been increased from 500 to 999.</p></li>
<li><p>The Gener listing file is now optional. If a listing is not
generated, then a log file (.log) will created instead. The log file
includes diagnostics and summary information, but does not include
the MCD or any trace information.</p></li>

<h3>Virtual Machine<a class="headerlink" href="#virtual-machine" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Virtual Machine (VM) now supports up to 4 simulation windows
<a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image143.png"><img alt="image14" src="../../_images/image143.png" style="width: 1.92in; height: 1.20035in;" /></a>that can each be independently docked or floated as
required. These windows can be individually toggled from the
<em>Simulation»Virtual Machine</em> menu (shown at right). The visibility of
the simulation windows can also be toggled from the View toolbar.
When <em>Lock View Properties</em> is set, property changes to one window
are applied to all; otherwise properties of each window can be
individually controlled. A faint green border indicates the
simulation window that currently has the focus.</p></li>
<li><p>The Tools/Holders/Heads dialog (Ctrl-Alt-T) has been redesigned.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image153.png"><img alt="image15" src="../../_images/image153.png" style="width: 5.54in; height: 2.22in;" /></a></p>
<p>The left side of the dialog lists the tools, holders and heads in
tabular format. The center section of the dialog provides controls to
modify the tools and holders. The right side of the dialog has
construction and 3D previews of the tools and holders, which are
dynamically updated to reflect changes as they are made. Changed tools
and holders are listed in red until the changes are committed via an
Apply button.</p>
<p>The following enhancements have been made with respect to tools and
holders:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Profile milling tools now support the “Body offset (o)” parameter,
which offsets the non-cutting profiles of the profile tool by the
specified amount. Use this to eliminate collisions when the
non-cutting portion of the tool touches the part.</p></li>
<li><p>VM now uses the internal gouge tool for tool vs. part collisions
during rapid motions along the tool axis (i.e., retract or plunge),
and also when the tool is momentary not moving (e.g., when stopping
the spindle or during a dwell). This enhancement eliminates
collisions that could be reported when retracting the tool, or during
bore and other cycles that stop the spindle or that dwell at full
depth. [V23.0‑2017]</p></li>
<li><p>Holders now have a new “Act as a head” property. When this is
selected, VM will ignore the offset between spindle control point
(SPC) and tool control point (TCP) when calculating the expected tool
length compensation offset for any tool using that holder. This
setting should be used when the CNC (or model macros) already
compensate for the offset between SCP and TCP.</p></li>
<li><p>Attaching the camera to an object is now easier. Select the object in
a<a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image162.png"><img alt="image16" src="../../_images/image162.png" style="width: 2.52in; height: 0.98in;" /></a> simulation window and select <em>Attach Camera</em> from
right-mouse pop-up context menu. This menu will show a checkbox if
the camera is currently attached to anything; right-mouse in the
background and once again select <em>Attach Camera</em> to detach it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The pop-up context menu also includes functions to hide the selected
object in the current simulation window (i.e., the one with the faint
green border), or in all simulation windows.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <em>Simulation»Camera»Fit</em>, <em>Center</em> and <em>Pivot</em> functions now apply
only to objects that are both selected and visible. When no objects
are selected, these functions apply only to visible objects. This
makes it much easier to bring into view objects of interest.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Simulation»Options»Misc</em> dialog has a new Antialiasing drop-down
that lists the settings available with the workstation’s graphic
card. The chosen setting is kept in the registry and used on
subsequent runs (i.e., you must restart to see the effect of
antialiasing setting changes). This setting overrides any general
Windows Display property settings. Any effect on drawing performance
can be checked by enabling the FPS setting in the HUD.</p></li>
<li><p>For robot models, the <em>Controller»Axes</em> tab includes new Shoulder,
Elbow and Wrist controls that can be used to test out different
possible robot configurations for collision avoidance and
reachability purposes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image172.png"><img alt="image17" src="../../_images/image172.png" style="width: 4.03075in; height: 0.37495in;" /></a></p>
<p>These controls are available for known robots only. Send ICAM’s Support
department your robot model in “dmp” format to have it enabled for
configuration testing. The various Right/Left, Down/Up and Front/Rear
controls retain the tool tip position and tool orientation, but change
selected robot joints to choose between the possible solutions (there
are 8 in total).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We continue to work on ways to reduce loading times and speed
processing of jobs:</p></li>
<li><p>Various improvements have been done to shorten the loading and
restart times of jobs. The Loading dialog lists the time spent
loading and initializing various components of the simulation, which
helps identify those steps that are taking time. Use the new
<em>View»Loading Sequence</em> menu selection after loading has completed,
to recall the Loading dialog to see where excess time was spent.</p></li>
<li><p>For material removal simulation (MRS) the in-process stock,
machinable fixture components and tooling must all be “water tight”
meshes. That means no cracks, and no inverted or missing faces. The
process of finding and correcting these problems is called “healing”
and this is done during the loading process. This can take
significant time for very large meshes or those with poor quality.
The healed copies of these components are now cached in a binary
format, which shortens the time to load them on subsequent runs. We
also now delay healing of components until when they are needed.</p></li>
<li><p>In-process stock is now saved in binary STL format by default when
ending a process, which saves a little time on the save operation and
a significant amount of time when reloading it into the next process.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Simulation»Options»MRS</em> dialog no longer includes the material
removal simulation multi-core optimization option, since this has now
been enabled permanently. This optimization works best when in
Progress or Background modes, or when in Full mode with animation
control set to multiple Steps or a large Time Interval.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Simulation»Compare</em> function now uses as many CPU cores as
possible when comparing the in-process stock against the
corresponding design part. [V23.0‑1935]</p></li>
<li><p>The computation of the intersection curve between colliding elements
has been optimized. This noticeably speeds the manipulating of
TimeLine past long sections with continuous collisions. [V23.0‑2128]</p></li>
<li><p>The $FMSPIC macro function processing has been improved, which
significantly shortens the time it takes to generate an image from a
simulation window. Calling this function should no longer affect
window focus in other applications. [V23.0‑2141]</p></li>
<li><p>For Additive Hybrid machining…</p></li>
<li><p>VM now diagnoses (#1700301) when attempting to start additive
machining while the spindle is turning, or (#1700302) when starting
the spindle while additive machining is active, or (#1700303) when
attempting to start additive machining with a non-additive tool type
loaded.</p></li>
<li><p>A Generic additive tool type is now available, allowing definition of
the additive deposition area as an STL mesh.</p></li>
<li><p>Other Virtual Machine enhancements:</p></li>
<li><p>The HUD width now adjusts to be only as wide as necessary to show the
current operation and/or tool name. [V22.0‑2150, V23.0‑2150]</p></li>
<li><p>The Measurement functions now permit the selection of the tool and
workpiece reference markers.</p></li>

<li><p>The Manufacturing Extractors are continuously updated, which is why
ICAM provides an Integration Tools installer separate from the
Productivity Tools (i.e., main products) installer. There are far too
many minor enhancements to list here, but the following are some more
significant enhancements that may be of interest:</p></li>
<li><p>Enhanced 3DEXPERIENCE extractor that is based on an API (application
programming interface) supplied by Dassault Systèmes. [V23.0‑1947]</p></li>
<li><p>New Preference section “Simplify tool profile” option applies the
tool faceting tolerance to the CAM system generated profile. This
results in a tool shape having the minimum possible number of faces,
which speeds material removal simulation. [V23.0‑1950]</p></li>
<li><p>A new “Save As” button at the top of the interface saves the
extractor settings for the current process in the form of a template,
which can later be reloaded into a different process using the new
“Template” button also at the top of the interface. The extractor
uses name matching to apply the old template to the current process.
This can be used for example to easy configure multiple-setup
processes, or to quickly assign tools to various model tool-pocket
axes. [V23.0‑2003]</p></li>
<li><p>New Preference section “Merge non-machinable fixtures as a single
object” option that combines CAM system individual fixture components
into a single STL mesh instead of generating one mesh for each
component. This reduces program complexity and can speed
processing. [V23.0‑2005]</p></li>
<li><p>The CATIA, 3DEXPERIENCE, CREO and NX extractors now recognize CAM
diameter compensation tool-paths as originating at the tool center or
the tool edge, and they adjust the VM diameter compensation value
accordingly. [V23.0‑1948]</p></li>
<li><p>Fixture compensation offsets are now shown with each work coordinate
system listed, and can be easily modified by right-clicking on the
offset. [V23.0‑1948]</p></li>
<li><p>ICAM.DEF configuration settings</p></li>
<li><p>A new CIR_360 definition file variable controls the interpretation of
aptsource CIRCLE or MOVARC commands where the start point and the end
point of the arc are the same (or nearly the same) and neither INTOF
or ANGLE have been specified. The default is YES, which will generate
a full 360 degree arc matching past behavior. Setting CIR_360 to NO
will output a zero degree arc in this case. [V23.0‑1916, V22.0‑1916]</p></li>
<li><p>The INPUT_FORMAT symbol now supports “NX”, which sets the CIR_360
default to NO and the MSYS9 default to YES. [V23.0‑1916, V22.0‑1916]</p></li>
<li><p>A new MOTION_32K definition file variable can be set to YES to enable
conversion of PowerMill 32000, 32100 and 32200 class records to 5000
class motions. When a record of one of these types is encountered, a
#1017:n record is output where 'n' identifies the 32k record class,
followed by a MULTAX defining the count of triplets per motion, and
the motion data is output as 5000 class records. The MULTAX setting
is reset when an end-of-path 29000:0/99 record is
encountered. [V23.0‑2026]</p></li>
<li><p>The CAM interface kit on-line help has been reorganized and revised
to provide more pertinent information, and to eliminate unnecessary
detail. The following kit changes are noteworthy:</p></li>
<li><p>The CATIA interface kit has been renamed 3DEXPERIENCE. For upwards
compatibility, specifying CATIA as an interface kit name will now
select the 3DEXPERIENCE kit. The alias name is managed by a new
kit_aliases DEF file variable in the 3DEXPERIENCE\ICAM.DEF file.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, the ProNC interface kit has been renamed Creo. For upwards
compatibility, specifying ProNC as an interface kit name will now
select the Creo kit.</p></li>
<li><p>A new Fusion360 interface kit supports aptsource files generated by
the ICAM_GENERIC Fusion 360 post-processor. This post, which is
automatically installed by the CAM Integration setup utility, creates
ICAM compatible aptsource files from a Fusion 360 manufacturing
program.</p></li>
<li><p>The UGS_NX_APT, UGS_NX_CLF and UGS_NX_CLS interface kits have been
renamed to NX_ICAM, NX_CLF and NX_CLS. As mentioned above, the old
kit names can continue to be used to retain upwards compatibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Aptsource / CLDATA enhancements</p></li>
<li><p>The hyperMILL pof interface has been enhanced to support turning
operations; DWELL on DEEP, BRKCHP and TAP cycles; and the “NC Text”
event is now post-processed as an INSERT command.</p></li>
<li><p>The Mastercam NCI to APT conversion now uses the STEP qualifier
instead of obsolete and undocumented INCR qualifier for DEEP and
BRKCHP cycles. Secondary clearance for DEEP and BRKCHP cycles now
uses the BACK qualifier, and the secondary clearance for the
BORE,ORIENT cycle now uses the OFSETL qualifier. Specify the mcam3
format in the Mastercam interface kit to retain the old syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>The NX_ICAM CLSF template continues to be enhanced with #1003:##
records that pass along information from NX to the post-processor.
The interface also now includes support for wire EDM. The interface
kit on-line help describes the interface in more detail.</p></li>

<section id="general">
<h3>General<a class="headerlink" href="#general" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A new MACRO.ALLOW_SYSTEM_COMMAND definition file symbol has been
added that can be used to inhibit or prompt for confirmation of
execution of macro SYSTEM commands. The SYSTEM/'<em>command</em>' macro
command allows the macro processor to run another program or issue an
operating system command from within a macro. Valid choices for this
new parameter are as follows: [V23.0‑1907]</p></li>
<li><p>Select YES to process SYSTEM commands (the default).</p></li>
<li><p>Select NO to inhibit processing of SYSTEM commands. Diagnostic
#1118001 will be output for each SYSTEM command inhibited.</p></li>
<li><p>Select PROMPT to prompt the user for yes/no permission before each
SYSTEM command is processed.</p></li>
<li><p>A diagnostic is now output in GENER when attempting to invoke
variable look-ahead while the Declaration, LCS startup/shutdown,
Register or Tape macro is active, since look-ahead is not possible
while these macros are active. A value of $NULL continues to be used
by the macro processor when this happens, but now the post-processor
developer will be made aware of the problem. Also, variable
look-ahead previously had default values that were returned if the
look-ahead was invoked from a macro called by the machine shutdown,
but not when invoked by the machine shutdown macro itself. This error
has been corrected. [V23.0‑1921]</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="macro-functions">
<h3>Macro Functions<a class="headerlink" href="#macro-functions" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>General functions:</p></li>
<li><p>A new <strong>$FKINCFG</strong>(<em>axis,x,y,z,i,j,k)</em> function is available to
modify the position and the orientation of a rotary axis or the tool
axis. This function was designed to be used with CeRun but also can
be used with Gener. The axis is identified either by an index number
or keyword, and the position and orientation of the axis is specified
using <em>xyzijk</em> data. Calling $FKINCFG(<em>axis</em>,OFF) resets the axis to
its original position and orientation as defined in the
Questionnaire.</p></li>
<li><p>Gener functions:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$FGET</strong> and <strong>$FGETR</strong> can now use a regular expression (RE) string
to identify the CLDATA record being searched for. The RE is matched
against the ASCII representation of the binary record (i.e., as is
shown in the run-time Source window). For example, the following
function call can be used to search for the next diameter
compensation command. [V23.0‑1934]</p></li>
</ul>
<p>$FGET({'CUTCOM/LEFT','CUTCOM/RIGHT'})</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>CeRun functions:</p></li>
<li><p>A new <strong>$FCEDAC</strong>(<em>data</em>[,<em>n</em>]) function (meaning Data As Code)
is available to allow a data identifier <em>data</em> to fire actions
without the explicit need for a code definition. By associating a
specific data identifier to a code group number <em>n</em>, an MCD block
containing this data identifier will fire the current modal code from
the group; provided that there is no other code from that same group
already queued for processing on the block. This is the same
mechanism that is internally used to for the QUEST Spindle section
question “Presence of speed code changes speed”, which associates the
reg_spindle_rpm with the spindle code group.</p></li>
<li><p>A new <strong>$FCERST</strong>(<em>file</em>[,<em>line</em>[,<em>reset</em>]]) function is
used to process NC programs that have been fragmented into multiple
files. This function can only be called from the machine shutdown
macro, and causes a restart when the shutdown macro completes. The
next program <em>file</em> will be used on the restart. Reading will start
at the specified <em>line</em> number (default is line 1) of the new file.
Specify $TRUE for the optional <em>reset</em> parameter to reset processing
as though this was the first NC program file in the series.</p></li>
<li><p>A new <strong>$FKINROT</strong>(<em>axis1</em>[<em>,axis2</em>]<em>)</em> function can be
used on machines with 3 or more rotary tables or rotary heads, to
select the rotary axes which will be used by the motion processor to
calculate the kinematics solution when the orientation of the tool is
given by virtual axes under RTCP control. The axes are identified
either by an index number or keyword.</p></li>
<li><p>Virtual Machine functions:</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$FMSADPT</strong> function now supports a new NORMAL option that
enables VM during normal post-processing, but disables it during
$FLOOK and $FINFO look-ahead processing. This can significantly speed
these forms of look-ahead, but it should only be used if the
look-ahead result is not affected by simulation.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$FMSCMRA</strong> function now supports additional properties to
support the Simulation»Camera Fit, Center, Pivot, Attach,
Perspective, Front, Back, Top, Bottom, Left and Right menu settings.
A predefined camera position is now set using the
“CAMERA.LOAD,<em>n</em>” property, but LOAD is optional to retain
compatibility with older versions.</p></li>
<li><p>A new <strong>$FMSDELAY</strong> function can be used to define a delay (i.e.,
dwell) that occurs in the simulation separate from any due to a DELAY
command in the program. During the delay, the HUD “Motion Type” is
shown as DELAY with a countdown of seconds remaining. [V23.0‑2137]</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$FMSHLD</strong> function has a new ACTASAHEAD property that is paired
with the run-time Holder dialog “Act as a head” checkbox. VM tool
compensation calculations ignore the holder offsets if it is acting
as a head. [V23.0‑1951]</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The $FMSHLD function also has new TOOL.A, TOOL.B and TOOL.C properties
that define the orientation of the tool at the tool contact point (TCP)
expressed as rotations in degrees around the X, Y and Z
axes. [V22.0‑1949, V23.0‑1949]</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A new <strong>$FMSMRS</strong> function is available to query and optionally set
the material removal simulation (MRS) activation state for the
current channel.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$FMSMSP</strong> “set master spindle” function has an optional
MILL-TURN parameter that can be specified with mill-turn models to
explicitly identify the spindle (i.e., milling or turning) that is
being set. If omitted, VM chooses the spindle based on the current
mode as usual. [V22.0‑1721, V23.0‑1901]</p></li>
<li><p>New <strong>$FMSPART</strong> and <strong>$FMSFIXTURE</strong> functions can be used to
dynamically create part/stock and fixture components from within
macros, in the same way as they can manually be created using the
Simulation»Part/Fixture dialog.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$FMSSLAV</strong> function has new parameters that provide more
flexibility when slaving one axis motions to another. A signed offset
can now be applied in addition to a multiplication factor. A new INCR
option will apply the Δ master axis motion relative to the slave axis
current position at the moment it was slaved, instead of relative to
the slave axis origin. [V23.0‑2122]</p></li>
<li><p>A new <strong>$FMSSREF</strong> function is available to set axes values for model
reference positions, which will overwrite any position already
defined by macro or by the model creator in QUEST. This function is
the counterpart to the $FMSGREF function that returns model reference
positions.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>$FMSSTPS</strong> function has a new “transparent” toolpath style #5
that turns off the toolpath display.</p></li>
<li><p>A new <strong>$FMSTOLER</strong> function is available to get and optionally set
the Gouge, Collision, Faceting and Tool path tolerances currently
being used. These tolerances are set at the start of processing from
values defined in the verification setup (.vsw) file. They can be
viewed and modified using the Simulation»Options»Tolerances dialog,
and now programmatically using this macro function.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="macro-variables">
<h3>Macro Variables<a class="headerlink" href="#macro-variables" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The following new variables are available with both Gener and CeRun:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$DYNFIX</strong> is a logical variable that indicates and can set dynamic
fixture compensation. This is a form of rotary table workpiece
compensation used for 5-axis positioning only. It can also be
controlled from Gener using the new CUTCOM/‌TABLE,ON-OFF command.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$SUBEXT</strong> is a string variable that defines the tape file extension
of subprogram files. Gener uses this variable when it creates a
subprogram file. CeRun uses this variable when it searches for a
subprogram file to open.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$TCLSET</strong> is a numeric variable that indicates and can set the tool
length compensation method on machines where there are multiple
length compensation methods defined. It defines the tool length
compensation method to be used if not explicitly set on the
CUTCOM/LENGTH post-processor command. Method 1 is the standard length
compensation supported by all machines. Methods 2 through 4 are
defined by the post-processor developer and include various RTCP
settings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$TCPSET</strong> is a numeric variable that indicates and can set the RTCP
method on machines where there are multiple RTCP methods defined. It
defines the RTCP method to be used if not explicitly set on the
MODE/RTCP post-processor command.</p></li>
<li><p>Gener variables:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$DCOMPM</strong> “diameter compensation method” variable can now be set to
control the output of PQR vector data. [V23.0‑2148]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$LCAUTOT</strong> is a new logical variable that indicates and can set
whether automatic LCS includes a translation component to locate the
LCS origin at the tool tip.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$LCPREFROT</strong> is a new numeric variable that indicates and can set
the preferred LCS axes of rotation when the local coordinate rotation
supports the “3Rotation” method (QUEST Control Description /
Coordinate System question #34). Choices are 1:CA, 2:CB, 3:BA and
4:AB. Zero indicates that the 3-rotation method is not available.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$PARTNO</strong> changes will now update the Gener listing
header. [V23.0‑2115]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$REGMATCH</strong> text values were incorrectly documented as identifying
registers via their register descriptor, but in fact the $REGMATCH
text was simply matched against the leading characters of all
register output and the register macro was run if a match was found.
To make this function more useful, the text is now processed as a
regular expression (RE) matching from the first character of the
register output. E.g., the string '[XYZ]' will match any register
output starting with X, Y or Z.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To match a register by its descriptor, use $FREGPOS('descriptor-text')
to get the register id.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>$TCPFMTOPT</strong> is a new numeric variable that controls whether GENER
can intermix machine rotary axes values with virtual rotary values
while RTCP is active. The value 1 (default) indicates that GENER can
switch to machine rotary axes output if necessary to force the
machine to a particular kinematics configuration. The value 0
indicates that only virtual rotary axes are allowed to be output,
thereby disabling collision and travel optimization algorithms while
RTCP is active.</p></li>
<li><p>CeRun variables:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$XDIAM</strong> “X axis diameter output mode” is now
available. [V22.0‑2141, V23.0‑2141]</p></li>
<li><p>Virtual Machine variables:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$VMACTTOOL</strong> is a new logical variable that when set true enables
material removal cutting even though the tool might not be spinning.
This can be used to simulate ultrasonic tools, EDM wire cutting,
punch press and other forms of non-rotating cutting tools.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$VMTOLER</strong> is a new numeric array variable of length 4 that
contains the current Gouge, Collision, Faceting and Tool path
tolerances.</p></li>

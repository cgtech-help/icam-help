Find
----

Use the find dialog (tools find menu or run toolbar find button) to find
a word or a sentence in the current window. You can set preferences like
looking for whole word only or case sensitive. The Find Next and Find
Previous will use those settings. Settings are remembered on a
window-by-window basis.

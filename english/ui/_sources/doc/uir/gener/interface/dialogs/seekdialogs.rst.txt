Seek
----

The Seek dialog is displayed when loading a CL data file in memory. When
the CL file is very large, there can be a noticeable delay when
searching for a particular line number. The seek dialog will be
displayed whenever GENER looks for a CL record outside of the buffered
range. A Cancel button is available to stop the seek operation.

Debug»Variables
---------------

This command toggles the opening or closing of the variables window on
the screen.

See the `Variables Window <../../windows/variable.html>`__ for more
information.

The Variables window is used to examine local, object, global and macro
system variables. The window is organized into left and right halves.

-  The left half of the window has a series of four tabs. The leftmost
   Auto tab lists recently referenced variables to simplify debugging.
   The Global and Object tabs list all global and object scope variables
   that have been defined. Similarly, the Local tab lists all local
   variables defined to the current point in the active macro. The
   contents of the Local and Object windows depend on the macro
   currently selected in the Stack window (see below).
-  The right half of the window also has a series of tabs, which you can
   use to organize and view local, object, global or macro system
   variables of interest. Local, object and global variables are only
   listed once they are declared (DECLAR command) or used.

Each time GENER is paused, it will identify changed variables with a
different color.

The right-mouse context sensitive menu provides quick access to various
options and features of the variables window. This includes the option
to list variables either alphabetically or in the order they were
defined, to omit undefined ($NULL) variables and even to export a
listing of the current state of each variable (there is no corresponding
function to import variables).

Variables can also be viewed by placing the cursor over a variable name
where it appears in the Source window. Variables can be “dragged” into
the right-hand watch window from the Source window or from the list of
Global, Object and Local variables in the left-hand half of the
Variables window. Once there, variables can be easily traced using the
right-mouse context sensitive menu.

The value of read/write variables can be changed by clicking on the
value (to assign the focus) and then typing a new value.

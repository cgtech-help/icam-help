Once post-processing has completed, the post-processor main NC program
file can be viewed by selecting this menu selection or its related
tool-bar button. The WordPad editor will be used on Windows systems to
view the file if there is no application associated with the GENER tape
file type. The “vi” editor will be used by default on UNIX systems.

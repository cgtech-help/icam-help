Debug»Stack
-----------

This command toggles the opening or closing of the variables window on
the screen.

See the `Stack Window <../../windows/stack.html>`__ for more information.

The Stack window lists the macro and sub-program call nesting order,
bottom up starting with the CL file. Each currently active matched macro
or sub-program is listed above its caller, in the order called. When you
double-click on a macro in the Stack window, you can view the macro’s
local variables in the Variables window and the macro source in the
Listing window. Double-click on a sub-program entry in the stack window
to view the CL file source of the sub-program in the Listing window.
Double-click on the lowest “CL source” entry in the stack window to view
the CL file source in the Listing window.

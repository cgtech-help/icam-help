File»Save For Review
--------------------

You can select Save For Review from the File menu. It will save the
current state of post-processing into a ZRJ file for later review.
Explicitly saving the process inhibits the automatic save that normally
occurs at the end of processing when the “save for review” launch panel
preference is selected.

To review an NC program’s results, drag and drop the ZRJ file onto the
launch panel or desktop icon (or open the results using the [Job]
button), then press OK. The Full interface will be activated showing the
results at the end of GENER or CERUN processing. These include:

-  Input, Output (GENER only) and Console window complete traces
-  Source window listing the input file
-  Diagnostic window listing all diagnostics
-  Virtual Machine simulation window
-  Controller window including TimeLine access to entire program
-  Material removal simulation in-process stock final state
-  View Listing and View NC code menu selections

The save-for-review function allows, for example, a program to be run in
background mode and then later opened for more detailed review if
necessary. The ZRJ file contains sufficient information to allow a
program to be rewound and reprocessed if desired (although this is not
recommended for production programs).

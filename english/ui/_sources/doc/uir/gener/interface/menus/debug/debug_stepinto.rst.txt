DebugÂ»Step Into (F11)
---------------------

Step to the next CL record/macro line on the current stack level or into
a new macro if one is to be called.

Used during debugging to process the next record of CL or macro line,
pausing at the very next record of CL or macro to be processed. When
Step Into is selected on a record that matches a macro, processing will
pause at the first executable line of code in the matched macro.

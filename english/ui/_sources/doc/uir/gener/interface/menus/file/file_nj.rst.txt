FileÂ»New Job (Ctrl+N)
---------------------

You can select New Job from the File menu. This will bring up the GENER
launch panel so you can set new options for GENER to use. This includes
running GENER against a different CL file or post processor. If you want
to restart GENER using the same settings you currently have, use the
`Restart <../run/run_restart.html>`__ command instead.

Stops post-processing and returns to the launch panel where new options
or an entirely different CL file can be specified.

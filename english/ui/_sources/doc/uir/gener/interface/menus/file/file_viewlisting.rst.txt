File»View Listing File
----------------------

This option is available when the processing is completed and will show
you the job listing file.

Once post-processing has completed, the post-processor listing can be
viewed by selecting this menu selection or its related toolbar button,
or by selecting the “View Listing” button on the progress dialog. The
WordPad editor will be used on Windows systems to view the file if there
is no application associated with the GENER listing file type.

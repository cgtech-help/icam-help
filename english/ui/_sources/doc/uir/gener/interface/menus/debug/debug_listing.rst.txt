Debug»Source
------------

This command toggles the opening or closing of the Source window on the
screen.

See the `Source Window <../../windows/listing.html>`__ for more
information.

The Source window is somewhat similar to the macro trace window, except
that the entire macro source is shown, with a marker identifying the
line about to be processed. Any macro can be examined in the window,
regardless if active or not. The source window also shows the CL file
source, both in its original APT format (if applicable) as well as its
transformed binary format. Breakpoints can be seen, set and cleared by
clicking in the gray area beside the line. Once a variable has been set,
it can be examined by placing the cursor over the variable. A tool-tip
will appear showing its value. Four buttons in the Source window
single-step through the macro or CL file in various ways.

The “GOTO Line” prompt allows to type in a line number and jump there
directly.

Window»Save Layout
------------------

The Window Layout menu can be used to save the screen layout, including
window sizes, positions and visibility, into one of five layout storage
memories. Toolbars position and visibility are also saved. After saving
a layout, you can recall it at any time by using the appropriate button
on the `Layout Toolbar <../../toolbars/layout.html>`__.

This menu item is used to save up to five different windows layouts.
Once you have organized the GENER windows in a way that you would like
to remember for future purposes, select the “Save Layout” menu selection
and choose one of the 5 listed layouts. Layout information is stored in
the Windows Registry so it can be remembered from one GENER session to
the next.

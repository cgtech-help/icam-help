View»Console
------------

This command toggles the opening or closing of the console trace window.
It displays messages from the system including any warnings, errors or
messages to the operator. It also contains the message to notify the
completion of the process.

After the window is opened, it will record in a buffer all the lines up
to the number defined in the **Console** field of **Number of Lines to
Record** in
`Tools»Preferences»Trace <../tools/tools_preferences.html>`__, so you can
use the vertical scroll bar in the window to review the process. At any
moment, you can resize the window, minimize it, or close it. If the
window is closed, all the records previously recorded will be erased.

Note that closing this window may speed up GENER execution.

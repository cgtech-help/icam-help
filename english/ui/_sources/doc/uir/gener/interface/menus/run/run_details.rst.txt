-----------

Similar to Step mode, using this option, you can click your left mouse
button in Output window to control the output stepping and the system
will output one register at a time. In this way, it tells you in which
order the software outputs registers so that macros can be written with
an understanding of the register output order, if the post processor is
on testing stage.

This toggle affects the stepping and display of NC program data in the
Output window. When Details are not activated, a Step in the Output
window completes when a new block of NC program code is output. When
Details are activated, a Step in the Output window completes each time
register data is written to the tape buffer.

CAM-POST GENER Interface
========================

The following menus are available:

-  `Files <menus/file/file.html>`__
-  `Run <menus/run/run.html>`__
-  `View <menus/view/view.html>`__
-  `Debug <menus/debug/debug.html>`__
-  `Help <menus/help/help.html>`__
-  `Tools <menus/tools/tools.html>`__
-  `Other operation (Synchronize) <other/synchronize.html>`__

A comprehensive tracing and debugging feature can be activated by
selecting the “full-mode” (or verbose) display. This display enables the
post-processor writer to better understand the relationship between CL
data, macro processor and resultant NC program data. It does this both
by tracing the processing of various types of data, and also by
providing the capabilities of a fully functional debugger.

   **Note**: The Windows interface currently provides more features than
   the UNIX one. Where differences occur, they are noted in the
   descriptions that follow.

When GENER is run in this mode, post-processing starts in a paused
state. The **Run»Play** menu selection or toolbar button can be pressed
to start post-processing.

There are four trace windows that trace (or list) various types of input
and output records. GENER provides **Run»Step** and **Run»Pause**
commands to pause processing whenever something is written to one of
these windows. The trace windows are:

A Synchronize function is available for the trace windows, using the
right-mouse context sensitive pop-up menu. Synchronizing on a line of
output in one trace window, causes all other trace windows to identify
the corresponding point they were at when the selected line was output.
On Windows systems, the up and down arrows can be used to change the
line of output being synchronized.

Diagnostic messages are listed to the Console trace window, and also
to...

On Windows systems, there are four debugging windows that can be used to
perform more advanced Visual debugging and testing of a post-processor.
GENER provides **Debug»Step Over, Debug»Step Into, Debug»Step Out and
Debug»Run to Cursor** menu commands (and keyboard shortcuts) to debug CL
and macro records, one command at a time. GENER also provides a
**Debug»Breakpoint Manager** to identify stopping points in your CL file
or post-processor where closer inspection is required, and **Debug»Macro
Manager** to individually enable or disable macros for testing purposes.
The debugging windows are:

On UNIX systems, the debugger is command line based. The debugger must
be activated from the UNIX command line or from the Options panel of the
GENER launch facility. Debug commands are typed into a Debug input
window, and the results are shown in the Console window.

Many of the features and functions listed in the drop down menus are
also available using the toolbar menus. On Windows systems, select the
Tools»Toolbar... menu selection to select the toolbar menus you want
displayed; the toolbars are fixed on UNIX systems.

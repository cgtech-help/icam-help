Macro Trace
-----------

This window traces macro execution.

After the window is opened, it will record in a buffer all the lines up
to the number defined in the **Macro** field of **Number of Lines to
Record** in
`Tools»Preferences»Trace <../menus/tools/tools_preferences.html>`__, so
you can use the vertical scroll bar in the window to review the process.
At any moment, you can resize the window, minimize it, or close it. If
the window is closed, all the records previously recorded will be
erased.

Note that closing this window will speed up GENER execution with
post-processors that use macros.

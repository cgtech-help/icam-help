Source
------

The Source window is somewhat similar to the macro trace window, except
that the entire macro source is shown, with a marker identifying the
line about to be processed. The source window also shows the CL file
source, both in its original APT format (if applicable) as well as its
transformed binary format. Any macro can be examined in the window,
regardless if active or not. Four buttons in the Source window
single-step through the macro or CL file in various ways.

-  **Step into**: Processes the current record (either macro or CL),
   stopping at the very next record (again, either macro or CL). If the
   current record matches a macro, then Step-in will stop at the first
   executable line of the matched macro. If the current record does not
   match a macro, then Step-in acts the same as Step-over.
-  **Step over**: Processes the current record (either macro or CL),
   stopping at the next record of the same macro or CL file. Unlike
   Step-in, if the current record matches a macro, then Step-over will
   not stop in the matched macro.
-  **Step out**: This is applicable when stepping inside a macro.
   Step-out continues processing past the last record of the current
   macro. After Step-out, processing will be paused at the next record
   to processed by the caller (either a macro or CL).
-  **Run to cursor**: Continues processing to the selected macro line or
   CLDATA record. Select the macro line or CLDATA record first, before
   selecting the “Run to cursor” feature.
-  **Go to line**: Use the edit box to enter a line number you want to
   go at and then press the Goto button next to it.
-  **A drop down list** showing all sources that can be look at. This
   includes the CL source file as well as any macros defined inside the
   post-processor.

When looking at the CL source, the popup context menu (right mouse
button click) will give you the choice to look at the ASCII version
(only if the CL source is one of the ASCII source accepted by GENER) or
at the internal binary version of the CL file.

You can set or remove a break point by clicking in the margin next to
the line where you want to set or remove a break point. You can also use
the context popup menu to set/remove or toggle breakpoints. The number
of lines visible inside the Source window can be set from the tool setup
options dialog. Leaving your mouse over a variable name will bring up a
tooltip window listing the current value of that variable.

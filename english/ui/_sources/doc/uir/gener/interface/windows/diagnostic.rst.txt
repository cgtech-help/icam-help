Diagnostic
----------

This window records all diagnostic messages output since the start of
processing, regardless of whether or not the window was visible or not.

The diagnostic window provides “filter” toggle buttons that can be used
to hide/show errors, warnings and informational messages. A right-mouse
pop-up window provides access to additional functionality, as follows:

-  **Mark as reviewed** marks individual diagnostics as reviewed, as an
   aid to a systematic review of the NC program. Various options permit
   marking of similar diagnostics. Diagnostics can also be marked
   reviewed by selecting them and checking the Reviewed box.
-  **Hide reviewed** toggle shows or hides all diagnostics marked as
   reviewed.
-  **Clear reviewed** clears the “reviewed” state of all diagnostics.
   The reviewed state of diagnostics can also be cleared by selecting
   them and clearing the Reviewed box.
-  **Clear sorting** causes diagnostics to be listed in the order they
   were originally output. Clicking on a diagnostic column header causes
   diagnostics to be sorted in increasing or decreasing order by that
   column’s information.
-  **Column** settings indicate the type of information to be listed.

Diagnostic window settings are remembered with other user preferences in
the Windows Registry

Stack
-----

This window displays the call stack of the post processor. At the base
of the call stack you always have the CL file. When a macro gets invoked
from the CL file then the call stack will show that macro listed above
the current CL file location. Each macro called from another will add
one more line to the call stack. When a macro is completed and the
process goes back to the caller, the macro that is exiting will be
removed from the call stack. The stack window gets refreshed each time
post processing is put on hold (paused).

When paused, you can use the stack window to examine where the process
was paused. The current context is, by default, the top of the call
stack. The context is what decides which variables are considered local
variables (See the Variables Watch Window). You can set the context to
any level of the call stack by clicking in the margin next to the stack
level you want to examine (or by double clicking on the line). The blue
arrow in the margin tells you where the current stack context is.

When post processing is resumed, GENER first sets the call stack context
back to the top of the stack.

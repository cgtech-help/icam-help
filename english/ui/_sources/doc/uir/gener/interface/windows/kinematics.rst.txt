Kinematics status
-----------------

The Kinematics status window is displaying the current status of all
components of the machine kinematics and transformation that may affect
the computation of coordinates that are generated in the output file.

**Context menu:**

The right-mouse context menu provides the following choices:

-  **Show limits**: This option displays the types of transformations
   applied to the coordinates used to compare against the travel limits
   of the machine. The series of transformation are displayed along the
   top.
-  **Show coordinate variables**: This option displays information about
   different coordinates that are computed during the process. The
   location of the variable is giving a hint about which kinematics
   components are currently affecting the coordinate calculation. The
   following coordinate systems are available:

   -  $XC,$YC,$ZC : CL file coordinate system
   -  $XW,$YW,$ZW : Local coordinate system (i.e. workpiece coordinate
      system)
   -  $XM,$YM,$ZM : Machine coordinate system
   -  $XJ,$YJ,$ZJ : Joint coordinates used for limit checking

-  **Show inactive status**: This option shows kinematics components
   that are currently not being used, but can be available to modify
   coordinate calculations.

**Kinematics status window:**

Each element of the kinematics is displayed using one of the three
different colors. Each color is customizable in the Tool/Preferences
menu. By default, the following colors represent the status of the
kinematics component:

-  [Black]: The kinematics element is active.
-  [Blue]: Element is active and has been modified since last refresh.
-  [Gray]: Element is disabled.

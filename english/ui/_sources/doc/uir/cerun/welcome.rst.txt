Control Emulator
================

**Welcome**

The ICAM Control Emulator is software that emulates or simulates the
operations of a computer numerically controlled CNC machine. It does
this by reading and processing MCD (machine control data, also commonly
called tape) in the same manner as the CNC would and by manipulating a
virtual model of the CNC machine, for one or more of the following
purposes:

-  To test the machine axes movements for over-travel conditions.
-  To test for collisions between tools, fixtures, parts, stock and
   machine components.
-  To test the effect of workpiece, length and diameter compensation.
-  To validate the MCD program for syntax errors.
-  To verify the correctness of the resulting as-machined stock.

Control Emulator consists of two parts: QUEST and CERUN.

-  QUEST is an interactive program that builds a database containing
   information entered about one or more CNC machines.
-  CERUN uses this database, along with the MCD files generated by a
   post-processor, human or other system, to emulate the actions and
   processing of a particular CNC machine.

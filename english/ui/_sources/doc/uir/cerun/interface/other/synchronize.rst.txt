Synchronize
===========

This function is available from the context popup menu when you press
the right mouse button one of the following:

-  On a line of output in the Input, Output, Console and Macro trace
   windows
-  On a diagnostic message in the Diagnostics window
-  On a tool-path trace or in-process stock cut in the Simulation window
-  At a time within the Timeline window

When “Synchronize” is selected, the item you chose will be highlighted,
and the corresponding trace, diagnostic, tool-path, surface and Timeline
location in all the other windows will also be synchronized. In the
Simulation window, the synchronized item will be blinking.

Console Trace
-------------

This window displays messages from the system including any warnings,
errors or messages to the operator. It also contains the message to
notify the completion of the process.

After the window is opened, it will record in a buffer all the lines up
to the number defined in the **Console** field of **Number of Lines to
Record** in
`Tools»Preferences»Trace <../menus/tools/tools_preferences.html>`__, so
you can use the vertical scroll bar in the window to review the process.
At any moment, you can resize the window, minimize it, or close it. If
the window is closed, all the records previously recorded will be
erased.

Note that closing this window may speed up CERUN execution.

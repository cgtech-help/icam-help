CERUN Option
------------

The Option dialog Processing tab is used to set the actions of the
Control Emulator when various special codes are encountered in the
program. These codes are identified by their post-processor command
name, if defined in the control emulator, as follows:

You can set the action for each code as follows: “\ **Pause**\ ” will
stop CERUN processing when the code is encountered. You must then select
one of the Run menu selections to continue or restart processing.
“\ **Halt**\ ” will end CERUN processing. Once halted, you can either
exit or restart processing from the beginning of the program.
“\ **Ignore**\ ” simply ignores the code, which can be useful to
continue processing past an END or REWIND code.

The processing options settings are remembered in the Windows Registry.

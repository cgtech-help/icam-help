Seek
----

The seek dialog is displayed when loading a MCD data file in memory.
When the MCD file is very large, there can be a noticeable delay when
searching for a particular line number. The seek dialog will be
displayed whenever CERUN looks for a MCD block outside of the buffered
range. A Cancel button is available to stop the seek operation.

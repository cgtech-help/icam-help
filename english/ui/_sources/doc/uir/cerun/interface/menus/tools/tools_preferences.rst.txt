Tools»Preferences...
--------------------

The Preferences dialog can be utilized to customize CERUN operations.
These customizations affect the CERUN interface – they do not affect how
CERUN emulates MCD code.

**General tab**

The General preferences tab allows the user to customize general
appearance and behavior.

-  Fonts and colors used in the Trace windows
-  Automatic generation of a “Save for Review” zpj file on exit
-  Display of a “Loading…” dialog at the start of processing

**Debug tab**

The Debug preferences tab allows the user to customize the visual
debugger appearance and behavior.

-  Colorization settings of text in the Source and Trace windows
-  Various debugging options, including:

   -  the display of variables with $NULL value in the Variables window;
   -  the display of a Pause/Continue dialog when a breakpoint is
      encountered; and
   -  the option to diagnose uninitialized macro variables when they are
      used in an expression.;

-  Enable contextual help of codes and registers in the Output trace
   window
-  Macro strong declaration setting, uninitialized variable testing and
   formatting
-  Selection of either the C style or standard APT style representation
   format of macro source

| Note that $FLOOK debugging and contextual help in the Output window
  are GENER features that do not apply to CERUN.

window size and content.

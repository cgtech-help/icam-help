Use this menu selection to activate or disable the various toolbar menus
available with CERUN. Toolbars can be docked along any of the sides of
the main window, or they can be detached as separate windows.

Tool-tips (balloon text that appears when the cursor is left on top of
an input field or control) can also be enabled or disabled from the
toolbar menu dialog.

HelpÂ»Package Job
----------------

Saves the current GENER processing state and all associated files into a
compressed archive file (i.e., ZIP), suitable for e-mailing to ICAM
Technical Support. The Package Job function can be run at any time
during GENER processing. The compressed archive will include the
post-processor and model, interface kit, input CL file(s), simulation
data, and all tape, listing and log files generated to that point. A
*job_info.html* is also included listing: system information; ICAM
environment variables; ICAM licensing; and GENER command line options.

A packaged job can be run by first extracting the contents of the
compressed archive to a folder and then running the extracted *job.cpj*
file.

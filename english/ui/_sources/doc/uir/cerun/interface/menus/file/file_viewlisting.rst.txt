File»View Listing File
----------------------

This option is available when the processing is completed and will show
you the job listing file.

Once control emulation has completed, the control emulator listing can
be viewed by selecting this menu selection or its related toolbar
button, or by selecting the “View Listing” button on the progress
dialog. The WordPad editor will be used to view the file if there is no
application associated with the CERUN listing file type.

Debug»Stack
-----------

This command toggles the opening or closing of the variables window on
the screen.

See the `Stack Window <../../windows/stack.html>`__ for more information.

The Stack window lists the macro and sub-program call nesting order,
bottom up starting with the MCD data file. Each currently active matched
macro or sub-program is listed above its caller, in the order called.
When you double-click on a macro in the Stack window, you can view the
macro’s local variables in the Variables window and the macro source in
the Listing window. Double-click on a sub-program entry in the stack
window to view the MCD file source of the sub-program in the Listing
window. Double-click on the lowest “MCD data” entry in the stack window
to view the MCD file source in the Listing window.

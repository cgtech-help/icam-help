View»Input
----------

This command toggles the opening or closing of the window tracing the
MCD data input.

After the window is opened, it will record in a buffer all the lines up
to the number defined in the **Input** field of **Number of Lines to
Record** in
`Tools»Preferences»Trace <../tools/tools_preferences.html>`__, so you can
use the vertical scroll bar in the window to review the process. At any
moment, you can resize the window, minimize it, or close it. If the
window is closed, all the records previously recorded will be erased.

Note that closing this window will speed up CERUN execution.

Debug»Breakpoint Manager
------------------------

The Breakpoint Manager dialog is used to define places in the program
where processing should pause. Breakpoints can be set, removed or
temporarily disabled. Breakpoints can also be saved and restored from a
file using the “File Open” and “File Save” buttons on the dialog.
Breakpoints can be remembered from one run of CERUN to the next by
selecting the “Remember breakpoints” checkbox at the bottom of the
dialog.

When CERUN encounters a breakpoint, it outputs a message that identifies
the breakpoint (since there can be many) and gives you the option to
either pauses the control emulator or to continue to the next breakpoint
or end of program. If you choose to pause processing, select
**Run»Play** or **Run»Fast** to continue processing when you are ready.
Breakpoints can be set for the following:

-  On a macro line, to break before executing the macro command.
-  On a block of MCD identified by its block or sequence (e.g., N
   register) number.
-  After a selected macro variable is assigned a new value.
-  When a selected code or data identifier is processed.

It is easier to set macro line and MCD block breakpoints using the
Source window. First select the MCD or macro using the drop down list in
the upper right corner of the Source window. Then click with the mouse
in the left-hand border beside the MCD block or macro line where a
breakpoint is desired. A solid red circle will appear to show that a
breakpoint has been set. Hollow red circle symbols indicate breakpoints
that are disabled. Click on the circle icon to delete an existing
breakpoint.

When debugging a composite control emulator with multiple independent
kernels, macros from different kernels can be differentiated from each
other by the control emulator name, which will appear in parentheses
beside the macro name.

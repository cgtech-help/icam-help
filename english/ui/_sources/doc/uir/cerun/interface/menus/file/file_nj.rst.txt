FileÂ»New Job (Ctrl+N)
---------------------

You can select New Job from the File menu. This will bring up the CERUN
launch panel so you can set new options for CERUN to use. This includes
running CERUN against a different MCD file or CE. If you want to restart
CERUN using the same settings you currently have, use the
`Restart <../run/run_restart.html>`__ command instead.

Stops control emulation and returns to the launch panel where new
options or an entirely different MCD file can be specified.

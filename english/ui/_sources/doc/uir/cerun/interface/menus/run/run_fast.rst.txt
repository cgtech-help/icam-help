Run»Fast (F8)
-------------

In this mode, the display window will be closed and a small `Progress
Window <../../dialogs/progresswindows.html>`__ will appear just to
display the process status with a progress bar, where you can choose
“Abort” to terminate the process or “More info...” to restore the
multi-window display.

Continues processing after it has been paused, hiding the full display
window and showing instead the smaller progress window. The progress
window requires much less CPU to update than the full display window.
Use the Fast-forward function to more quickly advance through the MCD
file from one point of interest to another. Break-point checking remains
enabled when the progress window is active. The [More Info»] button on
the progress window can be pressed to restore the full display window.

Debug»Source
------------

This command toggles the opening or closing of the Source window on the
screen.

See the `Source Window <../../windows/listing.html>`__ for more
information.

The Source window is somewhat similar to the macro trace window, except
that the entire macro source is shown, with a marker identifying the
line about to be processed. Any macro can be examined in the window,
regardless if active or not. The source window also shows the MCD file
source. Breakpoints can be seen, set and cleared by clicking in the gray
area beside the line. Once a variable has been set, it can be examined
by placing the cursor over the variable. A tool-tip will appear showing
its value. Four buttons in the Source window single-step through the
macro or MCD file in various ways.

The “GOTO Line” prompt allows to type in a line number and jump there
directly.

RunÂ»Step (F7)
-------------

This mode allows you to control the processing speed at a step-by-step
pace. You can start this mode from both Play and Pause mode. If you
choose Step mode in either Run menu or tool bar Step button, the
currently active window will be the controlled window to move one block
or one tool motion in Verify window when you click on Step button. If
you use the screen menu in any of the windows, that window will be
activated and become the controlled window. In step mode, you can always
use your left mouse button in the controlled window to initiate a step.

Pauses processing after the next line of trace output is written to the
sub-window that currently has focus. Clicking with the left-mouse button
in a trace window is a shortcut for the Step feature.

The main interface is divided into 3 main parts:

The `Navigator <navigator.html>`__ occupies the left hand side of the
display. It is used to quickly navigate through databases and post
processors. The button tabs at the bottom of the navigator switch
between the database and individual post processors that have been
loaded into memory.

The `Workspace <workspaces/workspaces.html>`__ occupies the upper right
hand section of the display. This window is used for virtually all input
and modification of post processors.

The `Console View <consoleview.html>`__ occupies the lower right hand
section of the display. This view contains various tabs that display
help information, the current state of processing, found text and
differences between post processors.

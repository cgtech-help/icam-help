Code Table View
---------------

The Code Table summarises the CODE type data responses in the
questionnaire and it's associated DATA type data. Codes are *actions*
which are processed by the runtime module (e.g., G4 is a "dwell"
action code). Datas used by the Code are displayed as subsets of the
Code.

A CODE is basically a register or text that will be matched on the block
and that will fire actions. Like G01 is a register used as a CODE to
fire the linear interpolation action.

It is important to distinguish a CODE from a `DATA
register <datacustomview.html>`__. Both are identified from the block
text, then the CODES are executing actions and those actions are using
the DATA registers as their parameters. For example, the CODE_LINEAR
code is using all the axis REG_AXIS_X, REG_AXIS_Y, ... as its values.

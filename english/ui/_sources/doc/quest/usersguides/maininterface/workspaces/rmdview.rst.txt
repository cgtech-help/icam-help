RMD View
--------

RMD is an acronym for Rapid Macro Development. The RMD View as activated
from the Startup/Shutdown macro section when a startup or shutdown macro
is desired. These macros are automatically activated when specific
events occur in the program.

To create or modify an RMD macro, first select an event type from the
Startup/Shutdown Procedures section, then click the *Modify* button. A
clear icon in front of the event type indicates that an RMD macro does
not yet exist for this event. A solid green icon indicates an active RMD
macro. RMD macros can be inactivated by clearing the checkbox (the icon
changes color).

**Close:** Closes the startup/shutdown procedures section.

A typical RMD view follows:

RMD macros consist of a series of modular operations or actions. A large
choice of available actions is listed in the *Actions* window. The
*Macro* window lists the actions that have already been selected.

To add an action, select it, optionally select where in the Macro list
it should follow, then click on the *Add*>> button. Some RMD actions
require additional information. If so, an `RMD
Prompt <../../dialogs/rmdprompt.html>`__ dialog will appear. When adding
a custom macro, the `Macro Editor View <macroeditorview.html>`__ will
appear so you can create the macro. To modify one of the actions in the
Macro list, select it and then click *Modify* (the same `RMD
Prompt <../../dialogs/rmdprompt.html>`__ or `Macro Editor
View <macroeditorview.html>`__ will appear). To delete one or more
actions, first select them, then click *Delete*. To reorder an action
(actions are listed in the order they are run), either select it and use
the arrow buttons, or select and hold the mouse button down to drag and
drop the action to its new position. To disable an action, uncheck the
box left of the action name.

**Cancel:** Closes the RMD macro discarding all changes (can **not** be
undone).

**OK:** Closes the RMD macro keeping all changes.

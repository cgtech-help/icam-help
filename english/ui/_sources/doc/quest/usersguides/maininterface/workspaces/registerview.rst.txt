Register View
-------------

|image1|

The Register View is used to create and modify the set the registers
(words) recognized by the control. The Register View can be activated in
two ways. The first is by double clicking on the *General Description /
Registers* section in the `post processor
navigator <../navigator.html#Post%20Processor%20Navigator>`__. The second
is by selecting the *Panel* response on any question that requests a
register. In this case, the *Init* button will be replaced by a *Select*
button, which is then used to select a register in response to the
question.

To add a register, optionally select an existing register that is
similar in format, click on the *Add* button, and the
`Register <../../dialogs/register.html>`__ dialog will appear. Use this
dialog to enter name and format information about the register. If a
register is not selected before clicking *Add*, QUEST will suggest a
register name and format based on industry standards. To modify a
register, select it and then click *Modify* (the same
`Register <../../dialogs/register.html>`__ dialog will appear). You can
select multiple registers for modification at the same time (useful when
changing register precision or other format details). To delete one or
more registers, first select them, then click *Delete*. To reorder a
register (registers are listed in the order they should be output on a
block), either select it and use the arrow buttons, or select and hold
the mouse button down to drag and drop the register to its new position.

The *Enable* state of any register can be set or cleared, to enable or
disable the output of the register to the tape file.

Infinite level Do and Undo is available while you are in the register
section. Once you exit the section, however, you can not undo individual
changes.

**Init:** This button deletes all existing registers in the table and
reinitializes the register table using the `Initialize
Registers <../../dialogs/initializeregisters.html>`__ dialog. Use with
caution.

**Select:** First select a register and then click *Select* to close the
Register View and return to the original Question View. The selected
register will be taken as the response to the register question.

**Cancel:** This button closes the Register View, discarding any changes
that were made (this action **can not** be undone).

**OK** or **Close:** This button closes the Register View saving all
changes.

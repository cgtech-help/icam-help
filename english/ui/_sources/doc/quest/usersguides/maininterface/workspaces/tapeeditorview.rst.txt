Tape Editor View
----------------

|image1|

The Tape Editor View is used to create regular expression substitution
strings, which can be used to perform rudimentary editing of tape files.
The *Find* column lists regular expression strings. The *Replace* column
lists the corresponding substitution string, if any. The *Test* column
shows the result of applying each Find/Replace operation on a sample
test string (entered in the Test string field).

To add a Find/Replace action, optionally select where in the list the
new action should follow, then click on the *Add* button. AÂ 
`Replacement String <../../dialogs/replacementstring.html>`__ dialog will
appear. To modify one of the actions in the list, select it and then
click *Modify* (the same `Replacement
String <../../dialogs/replacementstring.html>`__ dialog will appear). To
delete an action, first select it, then click *Delete*. To reorder an
action (actions are listed in the order they are applied), either select
it and use the arrow buttons, or select and hold the mouse button down
to drag and drop the action to its new position. To disable an action,
uncheck the box left of the action name.

Infinite level Do and Undo is available while you are in the tape
editor. Once you exit the section, however, you can not undo individual
changes.

**Reset:** This button resets the section to an initial "never answered"
state (this action can be undone).

**Cancel:** This button closes the Tape Editor View, discarding any
changes that were made (this action **can not** be undone).

**OK:** This button closes the Tape Editor View saving all changes.

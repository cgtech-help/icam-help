Macro View
----------

User Defined Syntax macros
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Macro View is used when adding, modifying and deleting User Defined
Syntax macros. The Macro View can be activated in two ways. The first is
by double clicking on the *User Defined Syntax Macros* section in the
`post processor
navigator <../navigator.html#Post%20Processor%20Navigator>`__. All macros
are listed, as are the *Load* and *Dump* buttons. The second is by
double clicking on one of the top level macro names listed in the *User
Defined Syntax Macros* section. In this case, just those macros that
match that command will appear.

To add a new macro, click on the *Add* button and the `New
Macro <../../dialogs/newmacro.html>`__ dialog will appear. To modify a
macro, first select a macro and then click on the *Modify* button to
bring up the `Macro Editor View <macroeditorview.html>`__. To delete a
macro, select a macro and click on the *Delete* button. To reorder a
macro, either select it and use the arrow buttons, or select and hold
the mouse button down to drag and drop the macro to its new position
(macros sharing the same command name must remain in groups).

It is possible to select multiple macros in the list to be edited at the
same time. When used, all selected macros will be shown in the same
macro editor, separated by ENDMAC command. This is very useful when
doing a global search and replace.

**Show RMD Macro:** (*User Defined Syntax Macros section only*) When
checked, RMD macros that are defined will be shown in the list. This
provides the possibility to look at and to modify RMD macros as if they
were regular custom macros.

-  **Load...:** Loads macros from a file, optionally replacing macros
   already in the post processor.
-  **Export:** Writes all User Defined Syntax macros to a file.
-  **Close:** Closes the Macro View.

User Function macros
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The macro view is also used for the User Function macros. The view can
be activated by double clicking on the *User Function Macros* section in
the `PP, CE and Model navigator <../navigator.html>`__.

To add a new macro, click on the *Add* button and a dialog asking for
the new function macro name will appear. The name of the macro has the
same limitation as the user variable name through the DECLAR syntax. To
modify a macro, first select a macro and then click on the *Modify*
button to bring up the `Macro Editor View <macroeditorview.html>`__. To
delete a macro, select a macro and click on the *Delete* button.

-  **Load...:** Loads macros from a file containing function macros.
-  **Export:** Writes all User Function macros to a file.
-  **Close:** Closes the Macro View.

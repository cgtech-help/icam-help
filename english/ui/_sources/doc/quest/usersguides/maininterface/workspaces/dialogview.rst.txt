Dialog View
-----------

The Dialog View is used to manage post processor dialog templates.
Dialogs are used by GENER to interactively query the user for input. In
this view, you can *add*, *modify* or *delete* dialogs from the list
(dialogs are always listed alphabetically — the order is not relevant).

**Load:** Used to load one or more dialogs from a file that has been
created using the “Dump” feature. Useful to export dialogs from a post
and import them into another post.

**Dump:** Used to dump one or more dialogs to a file. When using the
$FDIALOG() function option to display a dialog defined in a file
(instead of in a post), the file must be created using the Dump feature.

**Close:** Exit the dialog section.

The Code Macro View is used when adding, modifying and deleting Code
macros. The Code Macro View can be activated in two ways. The first is
by double clicking on the *Code Macros* section in the `Control Emulator
Navigator <../navigator.html#CE%20Navigator>`__. All macros are listed.
The second is by double clicking on one of the top level macro names
listed in the *Code Macros* section.

To add a new code macro, click on the *Add* button and the `New Code
Macro <../../dialogs/newcodemacro.html>`__ dialog will appear.

To modify a code macro, first select a macro and then click on the
*Modify* button to bring up the `Macro Editor
View <macroeditorview.html>`__.

To modify the matching expression of a code macro, first select a macro
and then click on the small arrow on the right of the *Modify* button to
bring up the `Code Properties dialog <../../dialogs/codemodify.html>`__.

To delete a macro, select a macro and click on the *Delete* button.

To reorder a macro, either select it and use the arrow buttons, or
select and hold the mouse button down to drag and drop the macro to its
new position (macros sharing the same command name must remain in
groups).

**Close:** Closes the Code Macro View.

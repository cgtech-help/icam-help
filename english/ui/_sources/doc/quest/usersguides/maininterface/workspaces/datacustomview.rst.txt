Data Customization View (Control Emulator only)
-----------------------------------------------

Just like the CODE customization section, the DATA customization one is
showing the list of data registers that can be matched by the Control
Emulator.

It is important to distinguish a DATA from a `CODE
register <codecustomview.html>`__. Both are identified from the block
text, then the CODES are executing actions and those actions are using
the DATA registers as their parameters. For example, the CODE_LINEAR
code is using all the axis REG_AXIS_X, REG_AXIS_Y, ... as its values.

The original list is built by parsing the questionnaire data. Specific
customization to the data register can then be done.

Just like with the `CODE customization <codecustomview.html>`__ section,
you can also create user defined DATA entries and make aliases of data
identifiers.

**Column Definition**

-  **Enable**: All data registers having this column checked will be
   recognized by the CE processing engine. Disable if you want to ignore
   a specific register, even if it was added by the questionnaire data.
-  **Process**: Having this column checked means that the register will
   be processed normally. If unchecked, the register will be recognized
   by the CE but will be ignored and discarded. This is a way to prevent
   specific actions for firing without outputting errors and warnings
   related to the register being unmatched.
-  **Modal**: A modal data register is a register that has its value
   saved so that actions can access it at anytime even on blocks where
   the data register do not appear.
-  **Identifier**: This show the text identifier representing the data
   register. This field cannot be modified.
-  **Register**: This field identify the register that is in use by the
   data register entry.
-  **Min**: For a data register, the min and max values can be used has
   a range validation.
-  **Max**: For a data register, the min and max values can be used has
   a range validation.
-  **\*n**: This is a factor that will be multiplied to the data
   register value after being matched.
-  **+n**: This is a number that will be added to the data register
   value after being matched.

**Context menu (right mouse button)**

Right-clicking on a selected entry will show the context menu which
gives you multiple operation choices beside the standard *Ok*, *Cancel*
and *Reset*.

-  **Create Alias**: By default, you can only have one register per data
   identifier. For example, letâ€™s say you have the REG_AXIS_X identifier
   set with the X register. You would be able to catch values like X2.3
   but if you would encounter X=2.3, you would need a register with X=
   as the name. So you can create an alias and choose the X= register
   for the same identifier.
-  **Modify**: Does the same as clicking the toolbar modify button. It
   will open the data identifier modification panel.
-  **Reset to**: If the cursor was on a modified cell (colored
   background) when right-clicking to show the context menu, this choice
   will reset that cell to its default value.
-  **Reset...**: Will show a small panel which allows you to reset
   certain fields on the selected items.
-  **Reset All**: Reset all fields on the selected items.

**Cancel:** This button closes the Data Customization View, discarding
any changes that were made (this action **can not** be undone).

**OK** or **Close:** This button closes the Data Customization View
saving all changes.

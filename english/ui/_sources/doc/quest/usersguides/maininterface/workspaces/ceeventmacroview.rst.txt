Event Macro View (Control Emulator only)
----------------------------------------

The event macro view is quite a simple interface that shows you the
macros available to enable. These macros are automatically activated
when specific events occur in the program.

To use one of the event macros, first select an event type from the
list, then click the *Modify* button. A clear icon in front of the event
type indicates that an RMD macro does not yet exist for this event. A
solid green icon indicates an active event macro. Event macros can be
deactivated by clearing the checkbox (the icon changes color).

**Close:** Closes the event macro section.

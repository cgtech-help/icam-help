The Database View lists details about the post processors contained
inside one or more databases. You can click on the column headers to
sort the items in ascending sequence based on that columnâ€™s content.
Click again to reverse the sort order. Double click on a post to open
it. You can also select multiple posts using CTRL and SHIFT keys, and
then perform an action, such as generate or export.

Select *View \| By Post* from the menu to raise the `By Post
Type <../../dialogs/byposttype.html>`__ dialog, which can be used to
restrict the database listing to just those post processors that match a
specific criteria.

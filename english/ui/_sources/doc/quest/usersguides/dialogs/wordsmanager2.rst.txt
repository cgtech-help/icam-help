This dialog appears when adding or modifying a keyword using the Words
Manager. When adding a keyword, both the name and the code value must be
unique. When modifying a keyword, only the name or the code value can be
changed, not both.

**Word:** The name of the keyword. Keyword names must start with an
alphabetic character and contain no more than 6 characters. When
modifying a reserved keyword, the name field can not be changed.

**Code**: The integer code associated with the keyword. For minor words,
codes should range from 1 through 9999. Major words have no such
restriction. Major words codes can be defined with two numeric values
using the **class:subclass** format. The class: component can be omitted
for 2000 class keywords.

**OK:** Accepts the change to the keyword.

**Cancel:** Ignores the change to the keyword.

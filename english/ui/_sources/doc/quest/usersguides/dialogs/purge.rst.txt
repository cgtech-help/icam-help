Purge
-----

|image1|

This dialog appears during a Purge operation on the database. A purge
removes older revisions of a post processor from the database, keeping
only the latest revision at each version level (version 14.0, revision
*nn*).

**Yes:** Will reset the revision number to 1 for all selected post
processors.

**No:** Will not reset the revision number. For example, if there are
three revisions of the post ABC01, as in ABC01;1, ABC01;2 and ABC01;3,
then following the purge, only ABC01;3 will remain. Answering Yes
(instead of No) would causeÂ  ABC01;3 to be renamed to ABC01;1 after the
other files were removed.

**Cancel:** Cancel the operation without purging files.

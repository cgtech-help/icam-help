This dialog is used to customize the properties of a dialog item
(control) or the dialog itself. Its content can change depending which
type of control you are customizing. Only the position and size are
commons from all type of controls. The X and Y size fields can be
disabled and that means the control which you are customizing cannot
have this dimension modified (i.e. Editbox height is fixed).

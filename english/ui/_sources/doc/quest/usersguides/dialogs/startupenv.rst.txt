|image1|

This dialog appears when exiting QUEST if the option needed to show the
dialog is ON (See `Preferences: General <preferencesquest.html>`__ ). The
dialog is used to specify how QUEST environment should be on the next
startup.You can choose one of the three available choices.

   **Blank**: QUEST will start without any opened or newly created
   document.

   **New blank post**: QUEST will start with a newly created blank
   post-processor.

   **Last environment**: QUEST will start and reload any documents that
   were opened the last time you closed the session. The section you
   were in will also be restored.

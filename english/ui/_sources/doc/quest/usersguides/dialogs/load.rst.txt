This dialog lists the results of running QUEST in a "batch" mode.

Batch processing occurs when QUEST is executed with a list of one or
more file names. Each file is processed based on its contents, and the
results are written to this dialog. Before/After macros are compiled,
TRN files are saved to the database (ungenerated), DMP files are loaded
as-is, and DP files are saved to the database (generated).

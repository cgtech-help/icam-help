This dialog appears when Generating a single post processor. Generation
is somewhat similar to saving, except that final consistency checks are
made, which enables the post processor to be used by GENER.

**Post Name:** Name of the post to generate. By default, the generated
post processor will have the same name as the ungenerated one.

**All posts in the selected database:** This window lists the names of
all posts in the selected database for reference. You can select a name
from this list, which will then change the *Post Name* entry.

**Select database:** This drop-down lists all databases that are open.
The generated version of the post processor will be written to the
selected database. Use the *...* button to browse for the database if it
does not appear in the drop-down list.

Calculator

This calculator is used to make conversions and simple calculations. The
Answer button sends the result as the answer to the current question.

The Inch (ALT+I hotkey), Feet (ALT+F), CM (ALT+C) and MM (ALT+M) radio
buttons convert the current answer from one units to another. The same
is true for the Deg (ALT+D) degrees and Rad (ALT+R) radians radio
buttons.

Holding SHIFT and pressing the minus key changes the sign of the current
answer (i.e., is the same as pressing the +/- button).

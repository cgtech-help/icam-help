**Add:** Add the incoming macro to the end of the list of already
existing macros.

**Skip:** Do not load the macro from the file.

**Replace Al**\ l, **Add Al**\ l and **Skip All** options perform the
selected action for all all remaining macros where there is a conflict.

**Cancel:** Discontinue loading macros. Any macros loaded to this point
will be retained.

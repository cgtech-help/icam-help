Initialize Registers
--------------------

This dialog appears when the *Init* button is selected in the Register
panel. It is used to define an initial set of registers (words)
recognizable by the CNC controller. Register format information will be
applied when the registers are created (by the *Init* dialog). These
formats can be later changed at any time.

**Machine registers:** Enter the complete list of register names (word
names) recognized by your controller. Only single letter register names
are supported from this dialog. You will have to create other
multi-character and type II register names using the Register panel.

**Precision:** Use these drop-down boxes to specify the number of
decimal digits before and after the implied or actual decimal point for
dimensional values. Different precision values can be specified as
follows:

   **Linear:** Specifies the register format for linear axes when output
   in the primary machine units.

   **Secondary linear:** Specifies the register format for linear axes
   when output in the secondary machine units.

   **Rotary:** Specifies the register format for angular axes.

**Decimal point:** Specifies how the decimal point should be output for
those registers that have fractional values. There are three exclusive
formats:

   **Keep:** The decimal point will always be output on registers that
   are defined with digits to the right of the decimal. For example,
   **X1.2 Y3. Z.4**

   **Fractional:** The decimal point will only be output when the
   register has a non-zero fractional value. For example, **X1.2 Y3
   Z.4**

   **Omit:** Decimal points will never be output. Older controllers
   often used this format, and relied on the count of digits to
   determine the implied decimal point location. For example, **X0012
   Y003 Z0004**

**Leading zero:** Specifies how leading zeroes (non-significant leading
zero digits to the left of the decimal) should be output:

   **Keep:** Leading zeroes will always be output. For example, **X001.2
   Y003. Z000.4**

   **0.nnn:** A single leading zero will be output for numbers that are
   less than 1, so that the value does not start with a decimal point.
   Otherwise, leading zeroes are omitted. For example, **X1.2 Y3. Z0.4**

   **Omit:** Leading zeroes will never be output. For example, **X1.2
   Y3. Z.4**

**Trailing zero:** Specifies how trailing zeroes (non-significant
trailing zero digits to the right of the decimal) should be output:

   **Keep:** Trailing zeroes will always be output. For example,
   **X1.2000 Y3.0000 Z.4000**

   **nnn.0:** A single trailing zero will be output for whole numbers,
   so that the value does not end with a decimal point. Otherwise,
   trailing zeroes are omitted. For example, **X1.2 Y3.0 Z.4**

   **Omit:** Trailing zeroes will never be output. For example, **X1.2
   Y3. Z.4**

**Show ‘+’ for positive numbers:** Select this box to have a "+" sign
output for positive numbers. By default, positive numbers are not output
with a "+" sign. For example **X+1.2**

GENER Test
----------

The Test feature can be used to test a short APT (or APT-like) program
against one of the post processors out for editing. The sample APT
program can be typed or pasted directly into the edit window, or
selected from an existing file. When you are ready to test, QUEST will
write the sample file to disk and post process it using the currently
selected post processor and selected interface kit. Result are displayed
in the `Test Result <clresult.html>`__ dialog.

**Input test file:** This is the cldata file used for testing. By
default QUEST uses *sample.apt* in its work subdirectory. You can select
another file by using the browse button. The contents of the file are
displayed in the edit box so you can modify them.

**CAM interface:** Select the CAM interface that you want GENER to use
when testing your CL test file. Installed interface kits are available
from the drop down list.

**Auto reply to prompt:** If your post processor prompts the user (ex:
PID, resolution...) then you may want to use the AutoReply feature to
automatically answer prompts. When enabled, you can add answers to the
answer list box by using the add button. When GENER prompts for
information, it will first use answers from the answer list starting
with the first one and going in the same order as they appear in the
answer list box. You can reorder answers by using drag and drop. You can
delete an answer by selecting it and pressing the DEL key. To modify an
existing answer, double click on it.

**Run with full interface:** If you check this box, the GENER launch
panel will be raised when you press the Test button. The current post
processor will still be selected by default and the CL file box will
point to the sample CL file. Using GENER’s full interface gives you more
flexibility on how your test is post processed, but it may required more
time to set up your test.

**Tracing:** The three tracing option allow a more detailed output to
the test result window. Note that the generated MCD is always shown.

-  **Input:** Traces input CL records
-  **Macro:** Traces macro records
-  **Diagnostic:** Traces diagnostic messages and completion status

**Test...:** When you are ready to test, use this button. The result of
post processing your test file will show up in the `Test
Result <clresult.html>`__ dialog unless you checked “Run with full
interface”, in which case the GENER launch panel will be raised.

**Close:** Closes the test dialog and returns to QUEST.

CERUN Test
----------

The Test feature can be used to test a short MCD (i.e., tape file)
against one of the control emulators out for editing. The sample MCD
program can be typed or pasted directly into the edit window, or
selected from an existing file. When you are ready to test, QUEST will
write the sample file to disk and simulate it using the currently
selected control emulator. Result are displayed in the `Test
Result <clresult.html>`__ dialog.

**Input test file:** This is the MCD file used for testing. By default
QUEST uses *sample.tap* in its work subdirectory. You can select another
file by using the browse button. The contents of the file are displayed
in the edit box so you can modify them.

**CAM interface:** This is used for GENER tests only.

**Auto reply to prompt:** If your control emulator prompts the user for
input then you may want to use the AutoReply feature to automatically
answer prompts. When enabled, you can add answers to the answer list box
by using the add button. When CERUN prompts for information, it will
first use answers from the answer list starting with the first one and
going in the same order as they appear in the answer list box. You can
reorder answers by using drag and drop. You can delete an answer by
selecting it and pressing the DEL key. To modify an existing answer,
double click on it.

**Run with full interface:** If you check this box, the CERUN launch
panel will be raised when you press the Test button. The current control
emulator will still be selected by default and the MCD file box will
point to the sample MCD file. Using CERUN’s full interface gives you
more flexibility on how your test is run, but it may required more time
to set up your test.

**Tracing:** The three tracing option allow a more detailed output to
the test result window. Note that the input MCD is always shown in the
form “\ *line-number*\ **!** \*mcd\*” as each block is processed, as are
the actions that the block generates, which are shown in the form
“ \*\ *\|*\ * \*action\*”

-  **Input:** Traces MCD input edits, register values, and CODE and DATA
   identifiers
-  **Macro:** Traces macro records
-  **Diagnostic:** Traces diagnostic messages and completion status

**Test...:** When you are ready to test, use this button. The result of
simulating your test file will show up in the `Test
Result <clresult.html>`__ dialog unless you checked “Run with full
interface”, in which case the CERUN launch panel will be raised.

**Close:** Closes the test dialog and returns to QUEST.

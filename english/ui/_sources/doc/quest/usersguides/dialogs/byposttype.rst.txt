This dialog box controls which objects (PP,CE,VM) are shown during a
Database list. By default, the last revision of every object in all
selected databases are show. You can change the default action using
this dialog.

**Name:** Enter a specific or wild-carded name to restrict the list of
objects to those matching the name. For example, **A\*** lists all
objects whose names start with the letter A. To list only objects
created under version 19.0, enter **\*.190;\***

**Machine Type**: Show only objects matching the selected machine
type(s).

**Object Status:** Show only objects matching the selected status.

**Show all object versions:** The database remembers each revision of an
object. By default, only the last revision is listed. Check this box to
show all revisions.

**Machine Descriptor:** Show only objects that match the specified
machine descriptor. The machine descriptor is a shorthand notation
listing the machineâ€™s configuration. You can enter a wild card
expression to restrict the listing to only those objects with a matching
descriptor. For example, **\*3\*** restricts the listing to machines
having 3 axes.

**Show objects in all database files:** When this box is checked, the
listing will contain objects from all databases listed in the database
navigator view.

**Database file name:** Restricts the listing to just those objects
contained in the selected database.

This dialog appears when Generating multiple post processors from a
database. Generation is somewhat similar to saving, except that final
consistency checks are made, which enable the post processors to be used
by GENER.

**Yes:** Will generate the post indicated in the dialog.

**Yes to all:** Will generate the post indicated in the dialog and all
others that were selected for generation.

**No:** Will not generate the post indicated in the dialog, but will
continue by prompting for the next post selected for generation (if
any).

**Cancel:** Cancels the operation. Will not generate the post indicated
in the dialog or any other post selected for generation.

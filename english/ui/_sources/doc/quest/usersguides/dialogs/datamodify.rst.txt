This dialog comes up when modifying one or more entries within the DATA
customization section. It allow you to change the value of anyone of the
customizable fields. Here is the description of those fields:

-  **Name**: Show the read-only identifier that is being modified. That
   field will be blank if modifying multiple entries at a time.
-  **REG_IGNORE**: If the dialog was called by adding a new data
   register, the name field will be a drop list instead of a
   non-editable text box. If the REG_IGNORE choice is selected, then the
   behavior of the data register will be to automatically ignore the
   matching register. Those data registers are actually ignored after
   the rest of the block have been processed. So they are usually used
   to avoid warnings about unused registers.
-  **Enable register**: All data registers having this column checked
   will be recognized by the CE processing engine. Disable if you want
   to ignore a specific register, even if it was added by the
   questionnaire data.
-  **Process register**: Having this column checked means that the
   register will be processed normally. If unchecked, the register will
   be recognized by the CE but will be ignored and discarded. This is a
   way to prevent specific actions for firing without outputting errors
   and warnings related to the register being unmatched.
-  **Modal**: A modal data register is a register that has its value
   saved so that actions can access it at anytime even on blocks where
   the data register do not appear.
-  **Register**: This field identify the register that is in use by the
   data register entry. Select the **[Add...]** button to define a new
   custom register if the required register format does not exist in the
   register drop-down list. Custom registers are identified by the
   string “(Custom)” in the drop-down list. Select the **[Edit...]**
   button to modify or delete the selected custom register. Take care to
   not delete a custom register being used for other purposes. The
   “\ **--NA--**\ ” (meaning not applicable) selection can be used to
   define a data identifier having no MCD representation. A register
   like this cannot be recognized from the MCD, but it can be activated
   via the EXEC macro command and $FCEADD macro functions. Using the
   combination of NA codes and NA registers makes it possible to
   construct a series of MCD commands (using EXEC) that call up custom
   functions and provide custom data, without interfering with normal
   code and data processing.
-  **Min**: For a data register, the min and max values can be used has
   a range validation.
-  **Max**: For a data register, the min and max values can be used has
   a range validation.
-  **\*n**: This is a factor that will be multiplied to the data
   register value after being matched.
-  **+n**: This is a number that will be added to the data register
   value after being matched.

**Cancel:** This button closes the Data Properties dialog without
applying the changes to the item in the Data customization list.

**OK:** This button closes the Data Properties dialog and apply the
changes.

The Finder utility searches throughout the current post processor,
control emulator or model, looking for questions, dialogs or other
customizations that match the specified text. The results are listed in
the Finder window (at the bottom right), where they can be selected to
bring you directly to where the searched text was found (i.e., question,
dialogâ€¦).

**Find what:** Text to find. Sorry, no wild cards.

**Match whole word only:** Only match the result if it is surrounded by
punctuation or spacing.

**Match case:** Normally the case of letters (uppercase/lowercase) is
ignored. When this checkbox is selected, the case of letters is
significant.

**Search in:** Use this option to restrict the search to text found in
one or more of the following. They are all searched by default.

-  Prompts: in the short question prompts
-  Descriptions: in the detailed question descriptions
-  Answers: in the question responses
-  Dialogs: in the Dialog section (dialogs are searched using their XML
   format)
-  Tables: in the Control Emulator CODE and DATA customization tables
-  Comments: in the *General Description / Comments* section
-  Macros: in macro code excluding comments
-  Macro comments: in the comments portion of macro code
-  Tape Editor: in Tape Editor search and replacement strings

**Search modified questions only:** Select this checkbox to restrict the
search to only those questions that have been modified (i.e., that are
different from the basic post or internal CAM-POST defaults). The search
string can be empty, to list all questions whose responses are different
from the default.

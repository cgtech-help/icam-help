-------------

|image1|

This dialog appears when *Tools \| Words Manager* is selected from the
menu. The words manager defines the association between numeric codes
and their corresponding keyword names. Code/keyword information is
stored in a file that is loaded when QUEST and GENER start executing.

**Words File:** Specifies the name of the file that is being used to
define the keyword list. The file name should be defined in the QUEST
setup panel (*Tools \| Setup, General*). A different file can be
specified by selecting the *...* button. Doing so affects the current
QUEST session only.

**Major/Minor:** Toggles between showing the major and minor word lists.

**Reset button:** Reset the list to its original state.

**New button:** Insert a new word into the list.

**Open button:** Edit a word from the list.

**Delete button:** Delete a word from the list.

**OK:** Saves changes to the named file.

**Cancel:** Ignores all changes made since the dialog appeared.

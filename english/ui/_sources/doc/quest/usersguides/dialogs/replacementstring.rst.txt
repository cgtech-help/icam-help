This dialog appears when adding or modifying entries in the Tape Editor.

**Replace:** Specifies a regular expression to match against a block of
tape. The arrow button lists common regular expression formats to aid in
the creation of the expression.

**By:** Specifies the text string to output in replacement of the one
matched by the *Replace* regular expression. If text was tagged in the
*Replace* field (using **\\(** and **\\)** operators), the arrow button
can be used in the *By* field to copy the tagged text to the replacement
string.

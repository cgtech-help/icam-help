This dialog appears when Saving a single post processor. Saving a post
stores the latest revision of the post processor in the database, but
does not make it available for use by GENER. Use Generate if the post
should be saved and made available for use by GENER.

**Post Name:** Name of the post to save. The name NONAME01 appears when
the post has not been specifically assigned a name.

**All posts in the selected database:** This window lists the names of
all posts in the selected database for reference. You can select a name
from this list, which will then change the *Post Name* entry.

**Select database:** This drop-down lists all databases that are open.
The latest version of the post processor will be written to the selected
database. Use the *...* button to browse for the database if it does not
appear in the drop-down list.

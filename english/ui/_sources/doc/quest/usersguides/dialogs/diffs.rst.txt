This dialog appears when comparing one post processor with another. The
results of the comparison will appear in the Diffs window at the lower
right.

**The latest version of this post saved in the database:** This
selection is available when selecting the Diff function using a post
processor that has been loaded from the database. When selected, only
those changes made since the post was last saved will be shown.

**Another post currently loaded in memory:** This selection is available
when there are one or more posts loaded in memory, not counting the
current one (NEWP01 in this example). Select the post to compare to from
the drop-down list.

**A post in the database:** Select to compare the current post to any
other post processor in any open database. The database is selected from
the drop-down list. Click on the post processor from the list.

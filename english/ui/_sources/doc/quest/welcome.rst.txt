CAM-POST is a post-processor generator designed for end users having no
software programming expertise. It can accommodate a wide variety of
machine types having up to five axes of continuous path control.
CAM-POST consists of two parts: QUEST and GENER.

-  QUEST is an interactive program that builds a database containing
   information entered about one or more numerically controlled (NC)
   machines and their controllers.
-  GENER uses this database, along with the cutter location (CL) files
   generated by an APT or CAM system, to produce the final NC control
   tapes for each particular machine.

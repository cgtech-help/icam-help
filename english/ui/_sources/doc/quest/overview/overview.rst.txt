QUEST Overview
**************

**QUEST** is an interactive program that build and maintain a database
containing information necessary to use ICAM’s runtime processing
software. Those are:

-  `CAM-POST GENER <generoverview.html>`__: QUEST enables the user to
   quickly and easily create post-processors by answering questions that
   define the functionality of a specific machine and controller
   combination. GENER use the post-processor from a database to convert
   CL data to MCD data.
-  `Control Emulator <ceoverview.html>`__: QUEST is also used to quickly
   and easily create CE’s by answering questions that define the
   functionality of a specific machine and controller combination. The
   Control Emulator runtime (CERUN) use the CE from a database to
   emulate a real numerical control, read in MCD data and drive a CNC
   machine simulation engine.
-  `Virtual Machine <vmoverview.html>`__: QUEST have all the tools
   necessary to efficiently create virtual machine models which can be
   used when post-processing with GENER or reading MCD data using CERUN.

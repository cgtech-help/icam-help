Tape & DNC
==========

|image1|

**Tape:** Specifies the physical output format of CNC codes (tape) for
post processors which are setup to output paper/mylar tape format
(search for mylar or DNC).

   | **Tape format:**
   | *Variable* indicates that each tape block will have a variable
     size, taking only the required space.
   | *Fixed* indicates that all blocks are of a given size. If a tape
     block is shorter than the given size, the record is blank filled to
     the end.
   | *Packed* is similar to fixed except that the next record is used to
     fill space at the end of a given record. In other words, packed
     tries to fit as may logical blocks on a physical record as
     possible. (``TAPE_FORMAT``)

   **Tape Record length:** If the tape format is fixed or packed the
   default record size is 72,80 where the first 72 columns contain data
   and the records are blocked at 80 characters. This default can be
   altered by specifying the data portion of the record and optionally
   the full size. (``TAPE_RECL``)

   **Tape sequence numbering**: Sequence numbering can be provided in
   the non-data portion of fixed length tape blocks (*fixed* or
   *packed*). By default, the numbering is in columns 73 to 80.Use
   *None* to have no sequence numbering. *Left* left justifies the
   sequence number, while *Right* right justifies it. Use *Padded* to
   add leading zeros to the sequence number field of the record.
   (``TAPE_SEQ``)

   **Tape end of record marker:** If the tape format is fixed or packed,
   the end of record character or characters can be defined. If special
   characters must be entered, use the standard CAM-POST ^### where ###
   is the ASCII code of the special character. For example, ^013^010
   would be the character codes for a CRLF end of record marker. Be sure
   to specify 3 digits when specifying the ASCII code. By default, there
   is no end of record marker for fixed or packed records.
   (``TAPE_EOR``)

**DNC:** Specifies the physical output format of CNC codes (tape) for
post processors which are setup to output DNC program format (search for
mylar or DNC).

   | **DNC format:**
   | *Variable* indicates that each tape block will have a variable
     size, taking only the required space.
   | *Fixed* indicates that all blocks are of a given size. If a tape
     block is shorter than the given size, the record is blank filled to
     the end.
   | *Packed* is similar to fixed except that the next record is used to
     fill space at the end of a given record. In other words, packed
     tries to fit as may logical blocks on a physical record as
     possible. (``DNC_FORMAT``)

   **DNC Record length:** If the DNC format is fixed or packed the
   default record size is 72,80 where the first 72 columns contain data
   and the records are blocked at 80 characters. This default can be
   altered by specifying the data portion of the record and optionally
   the full size. (``DNC_RECL``)

   **DNC sequence numbering:** Sequence numbering can be provided in the
   non-data portion of fixed length tape blocks (fixed or packed). By
   default, the numbering is in columns 73 to 80. Use *None* to have no
   sequence numbering. *Left* left justifies the sequence number, while
   *Right* right justifies it. Use *Padded* to add leading zeros to the
   sequence number field of the record. (``DNC_SEQ``)

   **DNC end of record marker:** If the DNC format is fixed or packed,
   the end of record character or characters can be defined. If special
   characters must be entered, use the standard CAM-POST ^### where ###
   is the ASCII code of the special character. For example, ^013^010
   would be the character codes for a CRLF end of record marker. Be sure
   to specify 3 digits when specifying the ASCII code. By default, there
   is no end of record marker for fixed or packed records. (``DNC_EOR``)

**Write block size:** This specifies whether the size of each tape
record is written at the start of each tape block. If the box is
selected, the size is written using two bytes followed by a space.
(``BLOCK_SIZE``)

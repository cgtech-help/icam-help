**Plot Format Type:** Specifies the output format of back-plot data
generated by GENER. *Binary* output produces a CL file that can be input
to any ICAM product that accepts binary CL files. *APT* output (the
default) produces an APT-like CL file. *CATIA* output produces an
APT-like CL file compatible with CATIA's NC Manufacturing Review
feature. (``PLOT_TYPE``)

**Plot Data:** Specifies the output units of back-plot data generated by
GENER. With *Machine* output, XYZ coordinates are in the same units as
the machine measured from the tool tip with vector information omitted.
With *CL* output (the default), back-plot coordinate data is in the same
units and reference system as the input CL data, also measured at the
tool tip, but with vector information included if necessary.
(``PLOT_DATA``)

**Start lookahead:** This value specifies the number of records to
search to find the first occurrences of the PARTNO, UNITS and MACHIN
statements. If 0 (zero) is specified, a search is performed on the
entire input file. (``START_LOOKAHEAD``)

**Max errors:** Specifies the maximum number of errors (severity 8 or
higher) that are permitted during post-processing. Once this limit is
exceeded, post-processing will abort. A value of zero (the default)
inhibits this feature, meaning that post-processing will not
intentionally abort. (``MAX_ERRORS``)

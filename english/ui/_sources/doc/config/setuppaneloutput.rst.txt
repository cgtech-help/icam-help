The Output tab setup is used by QUEST, GENER amd CERUN to set file
extensions for files that they output.

Listing files output by QUEST and GENER can use the standard format
(ASCII only) or the more modern HTML format. Using the HTML output
format will help you analyze your listing file by providing you with an
index file and internal link to important sections. CERUN only supports
the standard format.

**Standard Extension:** Specifies which file extension should be used
when creating output files using the standard format.

**HTML Extension:** Specifies which file extension should be used when
creating HTML output files (listing files only).

**Use HTML:** Check these boxes if you want HTML listing output.

**Reset:** Use this button to reset file extensions to their default
values.

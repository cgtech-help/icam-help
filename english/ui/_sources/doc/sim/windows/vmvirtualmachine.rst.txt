Virtual Machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image1|

Enables the display of the individual Virtual Machine simulation windows
if hidden or minimized, or hides them if already active. When **Lock
View Properties** is set, changes to one window are applied to all;
otherwise properties of each window can be individually controlled. The
visibility of the simulation windows can be toggled from the View
toolbar.

See `Navigating the Simulation Window <../other/vmcamera.html>`__ for
details on how to manipulate your viewpoint in the simulation windows.

It is important to note that collision and overtravel detection (CERUN
and GENER) and collision avoidance (GENER) are not affected in any way
by the state of the simulation window.

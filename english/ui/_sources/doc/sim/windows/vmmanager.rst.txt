Simulation Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image1|

Enables the display of the Virtual Machine Simulation Manager window if
hidden or minimized. Hides the Simulation Manager window if already
active. This window can be toggled from the View toolbar. The Simulation
Manager window lists all of the components included in the simulation
(i.e., tools, parts, fixtures) and where they are attached to the model.
E.g., parts and fixtures will be shown attached to stock mount points.

Double-clicking on a component or group header will activate a dialog
that permits modification of the selected component. As well, pressing
the right mouse button on any component or group header will bring up a
context menu listing the actions that are available with the selected
entry.

-  **Tools**: Lists the tools defined in the simulation. Double-click
   the header to activate the SimulationÂ»Tools/Holders/Heads dialog.
   Double-click a tool to view or modify it. Use the right-mouse context
   menu to change where tools are attached to the model.
-  **Parts and Fixtures**: Lists the parts and fixtures defined in the
   simulation. Double-click the header to activate the
   Simulation->Parts/Fixtures dialog. Double-click a part or fixture to
   view or modify it. Use the right-mouse context menu to change where
   parts and fixtures are attached to the model.
-  **Setups**: Lists the setups defined in the simulation. Double-click
   a setup to view it. Use the right-mouse context menu to add, copy or
   delete setups. Within each individual setup, use the right-mouse
   context menu to add or remove components from that setup as well as
   to modify the properties (e.g., position and orientation) of those
   components. Setups are activated in GENER by a LOAD/SETUP command or
   in GENER and CERUN by calling the $FMSSETUP() macro function.
-  **Model name**: Lists the components currently attached to the model
   tool and stock axes. Double-click a component to view or modify it.
   Use the right-mouse context menu to unload a component.

Virtual Machine Camera Manipulation
===================================

Navigating the Simulation Window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image1|

Simulation windows support both Perspective and Orthogonal projection,
selectable by the left-most button in the VM View toolbar. The middle
six buttons of the VM View toolbar orient the camera to face the Front,
Back, Top, Bottom, Left and Right views of the machine. The camera can
only be panned but not rotated while one of these standard views is
selected. At the start of processing, standard views are with respect to
the stock mount point, but this can be changed by selecting a different
component (e.g., the machine origin) in the VM Grid toolbar or by
attaching the camera to an object in the scene (more on grids and
attaching the camera to components later). The right-most button in the
VM View toolbar adjusts the camera aim and zoom (in that order) to fit
the currently selected object so that it is fully visible in the
simulation window (if no object is selected, then the camera is adjusted
so all objects can be seen). All of these toolbar functions are also
available from the Simulation»Camera menu.

The three buttons on the left side of the VM Mode toolbar select the
primary function of the left-mouse button (this can also be set from the
Simulation»Mode menu). When in “Camera mode”, holding the left-mouse
button down while moving the mouse changes the orientation of the
camera. The cursor appears as a four-way arrow when in Camera mode. When
in “Selection mode”, pressing the left-mouse button selects the object
under the mouse pointer. The cursor appears as a simple arrow when in
Selection mode. When in “Measurement mode”, pressing the left-mouse
button either starts or completes a measurement function using the
selected object under the mouse pointer. The cursor appears as an arrow
with calipers when in Measurement mode.

When in Camera mode, press and hold the Ctrl key to temporarily switch
to Selection mode. This can be used to quickly select objects to rotate
about or to attach the camera to. When in Selection or Measurement mode,
press and hold the Ctrl key to temporarily switch to Camera mode. This
can be used to get a better view of the object you are trying to select
or measure.

It is important to remember that with VM, you are moving (or flying) a
camera through a three dimensional scene. Changing your viewpoint
typically involves some combination of panning, rotation and roll.

-  **Panning** moves the camera up, down, left, right, as well as in and
   out of the scene. When in perspective mode, you can pan the camera
   through an object to see beyond it. When in orthogonal mode, panning
   in and out instead acts like a typical zoom lens.
-  **Rotation** changes where the camera is pointing, by angling it to
   the left, right, up or down (i.e., pitch and yaw). Camera rotation is
   similar to the actions of turning your head to the left or right and
   up or down. Camera rotation is only possible when a standard view
   (e.g., front, back) is not selected, since views lock out camera
   rotation.
-  **Roll** tilts the camera so that objects can be viewed from a
   different angle. Camera roll is similar to the action of tilting your
   head to the left or right.

*Camera Panning:*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following is a list of panning navigation functions. Hold the Shift
key while panning to reduce the distance the camera moves to 1/10th the
normal amount. You can adjust the overall panning sensitivity by holding
the Ctrl key and repeatedly pressing the + (plus) and – (minus) keys
(also available from the Simulation»Camera»Speed menu bar):

*Camera Rotation:*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Move the mouse while holding down the left mouse button to change the
viewing direction of the camera. There are two types of camera rotation.

#. The default rotation is to keep the camera position fixed but to
   change where the camera is aimed. This is similar to how we rotate
   our head to look around a scene.
#. You can hold the Shift key to change how the camera rotates. When
   Shift is pressed, the camera rotates around a point in space. This
   rotation point is by default the center of the world or the selected
   VM Grid object, but can be changed by selecting any object and
   choosing Simulation»Camera»Pivot (Ctrl P). As a quick shortcut,
   double-clicking an object in a simulation window will set that object
   as the Pivot center and fit the object in the window.

If you prefer the second form of camera rotation by default, clear the
“Default to Look-Around camera” check-box in the Simulation»Options
(Ctrl Alt O) dialog.

You can quickly orient the camera to point at the center of the
currently selected object using the Simulation»Camera»Center (Ctrl Shift
Space) menu function. Select the Simulation»Camera»Fit (Ctrl Space or
Ctrl Decimal) menu function to both orient the camera towards the
selected object and pan in or out so that the object fits within the
simulation window.

The following is a list of camera rotation functions available when in
Camera mode. Note that camera rotation is not available when a VM View
filter is enabled (e.g., Front, Side…).

*Camera Roll:*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The camera is oriented so that “up” is along the positive Z direction
(of the selected VM Grid object) in all views except Top and Bottom,
where “up” is instead along the positive Y direction. The following keys
can be used to roll (i.e., tilt) the camera clockwise or
counterclockwise.

*Camera origin and attachment:*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can attach the camera to an object in the scene. If the object
moves, so will the camera. This can be done using the right-mouse
“Attach Camera” context menu selection, which will show a check mark to
indicate that the camera is attached to an object. To detach the camera,
right-mouse in the background and again select Attach Camera to reset
the camera back to the world origin.

The Simulation»Camera»Attach menu selection can also be used to attach
the camera to the last selected object, or to detach the camera if no
objects are selected. Left-mouse clicking on the background will ensure
that no objects are selected.

*Camera viewpoint:*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|image3|

The creator of the machine model can (and should) define a series of
predefined views (not to be confused with the standard perspective,
front, rear, etc. views described earlier) to simplify viewing the model
during simulation. These might show a full view of the machine, a
detailed view of the table, perhaps a view from the tool’s perspective,
and so on. In the absence of any view information, CERUN will show the
machine with the camera placed well back in the negative machine Y-axis
direction, as shown in the image at right.

To switch between predefined views, press one of the keyboard number
keys 0 through 9 while holding down the Ctrl key. If the display does
not change, then that view number is undefined. You can define your own
viewpoints by holding down the Ctrl and Alt keys before pressing a
number key. Default views are stored with the model; personal viewpoints
are stored in the vsw file where they override those of the model.
Predefined views can also be activated and set using the
Simulation»Camera»Load and Simulation»Camera»Save menu selections.
Selecting Simulation»Camera»Reset in CERUN and GENER resets the
predefined views to those defined and saved in the model by QUEST.
Selecting Simulation»Camera»Reset in QUEST clears the predefined views
from the model.

The transition between views can be abrupt or smooth, depending on the
camera animation setting in the Simulation»Options dialog. Smooth
transitions are only possible between predefined viewpoints sharing the
same base view (e.g., two perspective views or two orthogonal views, but
not between a perspective and orthogonal view).

*To summarize:*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   positions.
-  **Simulation»Options (Ctrl Alt O)** sets camera animation and

Simulation Toolbars
===================

Toolbars provide quick and easy access to the most commonly used
controls. Toolbars can be activated or hidden using the ToolsÂ»Toolbar
menu selection, which opens the Toolbars dialog. With CERUN and GENER,
toolbars can also be activated or hidden using a right-mouse context
menu from the application window background. Toolbars are dockable,
meaning that you can drag a toolbar to any of the four sides of the main
window. Toolbars can also be undocked by dragging them away from the
sides (or by holding the Ctrl key). This section describes the Virtual
Machine toolbars and their associated functions and shortcut keys.

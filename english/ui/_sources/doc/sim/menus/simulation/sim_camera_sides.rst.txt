Switches the camera to one of six standard viewpoints (the VM View
toolbar shown at left provides buttons for each standard viewpoint).
Viewpoints are relative to the frame defined in the VM Grid toolbar (the
stock axis by default).

The camera can only be panned (i.e., not rotated) when a standard
viewpoint is selected. You can select and then immediately unselect a
view button, to first snap to a standard view and then allow camera
rotation.

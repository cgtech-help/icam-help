The Camera Save menu selection (Ctrl Alt 0 through Ctrl Alt 9 shortcuts)
records the current camera viewpoint, position and orientation in one of
10 standard user-defined viewpoints. The Camera Load menu selection
(Ctrl 0 through Ctrl 9 shortcuts) resets the camera to a previously
saved position. The camera can directly switch to the new position, or
it can smoothly interpolate to the new position, if both the old and new
positions share the same underlying viewpoint (i.e., both are
perspective views, or both are front views). The Camera animation mode
can be set from the Simulation»Options “use camera animation” check box.

When the Measurement mode menu bar selection is active, pressing the
left-mouse button selects the object under the mouse pointer for
measurement purposes. The cursor appears as an arrow with calipers when
in Measurement mode and measurements are shown in the simulation window.
Measurement mode can also be activated by selecting the circled button
in the VM Mode toolbar above. While in Measurement mode, you can press
and hold the Ctrl key to temporarily switch to Camera mode.

Simulation»Camera»Center (Ctrl+Shift+Space)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Camera Center function points the camera towards the center of the
currently selected object, or if no object is selected, then towards the
center of the world coordinate system (i.e., the center of the three
grids).

When the current focus is on the Controller Time-Line window, the Center
function will adjust the position of the time line so that the blue
vertical line (marking the current time position) is visible and
centered in the Time-Line window.

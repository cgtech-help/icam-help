Simulation»Show»Workpiece Reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Show Workpiece Reference toggles the display of a marker in the
simulation window showing the origin and orientation of the workpiece
coordinate frame. This frame includes the effects of fixture
compensation, RTCP and any local coordinate system (LCS).

The workpiece reference marker can also be toggled from the VM Grid
toolbar.

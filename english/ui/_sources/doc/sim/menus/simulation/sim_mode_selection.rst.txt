Mode»Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the Selection mode menu bar selection is active, pressing the
left-mouse button selects the object under the mouse pointer. The cursor
appears as a simple arrow when in Selection mode. Thus mode can also be
activated by selecting the circled button in the VM Mode toolbar above.
While in Selection mode, you can press and hold the Ctrl key to
temporarily switch to Camera mode. This can be used to get a better view
of the object you are trying to select.

Selection mode is useful when developing models with QUEST, or to select
objects to make them transparent, or to hide selected objects using the
Simulation»Hide Selection (Ctrl B) menu bar selection.

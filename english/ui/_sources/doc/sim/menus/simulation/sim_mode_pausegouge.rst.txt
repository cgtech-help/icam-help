Simulation»Mode»Pause Gouge Detection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the "Pause Gouge Detection" selection is active, interference
(i.e., collisions) will no longer be diagnosed between the cutting tool
and the design part. This mode can also be toggled by selecting the
rightmost of the two "pause" buttons in the VM Mode toolbar.

Temporarily inhibiting tool/part collisions can be useful to speed up
scribing or engraving operations, if part design does not include the
image being scribed or engraved.

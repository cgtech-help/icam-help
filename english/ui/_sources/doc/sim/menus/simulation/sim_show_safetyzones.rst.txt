Simulation»Show»Safety Zones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Show Safety Zones function enables or disables the display of the
safety zone that surrounds any collision enabled object that also has a
safety clearance distance defined. The safety zone appears as a
transparent light blue surface, offset from the original surface by the
safety distance.

An object’s safety zone is always shown in transparent orange when
another collision-enabled object touches it, regardless of the Show
Safety Zones setting. Colliding objects are always shown in transparent
red. The intersection between colliding objects is shown as a bright
yellow line, unless this feature is disabled in the Simulation»Options
dialog (Ctrl+Alt+O shortcut).

The Show Kinematics function activates or deactivates the markers that
show all axes types except for Reference Axes. The visible marker types
are as follows:

-  A **linear axis** appears as a pale blue ribbon line with arrows at
   each end. The current axis position is indicated by a darker colored
   band.
-  A **rotary axis** appears as a light mauve ribbon arc, with a single
   arrow serving the dual purpose of pointing in the positive rotation
   direction and indicating the current position.
-  A **curve axis** appears as a dark mauve ribbon connecting each of
   the points in the curve axis profile. The current axis position is
   indicated by a lighter colored band.
-  A **tool axis** appears as two 2D profiles of a holder and tool; one
   aligned with the X axis and the other with the Y axis.
-  A **stock axis** appears as a gold colored rectangle, with an
   internal red-green-blue coordinate frame marker.
-  A **head axis** appears as a gold colored 2D profile of a 90º head.
-  A **reference axis** appears as a red-green-blue coordinate frame
   marker.

The kinematics markers can also be toggled from the VM Grid toolbar.

The Show XYZ Plane Grid functions activate or deactivate wire-frame
grids showing the XY, YZ and ZX datum planes of the model. Grid
visibility can also be toggled from the VM Grid toolbar. Grids are
normally displayed with respect to the base frame of the model, but this
can be changed by selecting a different frame of interest from the
drop-down list on the VM Grid toolbar.

Grid spacing, colors, units and other settings are all controlled by
selecting Simulation»Grid (Ctrl Alt G shortcut).

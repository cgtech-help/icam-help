Simulation»Camera»Fit (Ctrl+Space)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Camera Fit function first points the camera towards the center of
the currently selected object, and then pans in or out so that the
selected object is fully visible within the active simulation window. If
no object is selected, then the camera will be adjusted to view the
entire model. You can use this function to quickly reorient the camera
when you are unsure of where you are pointing or if you cannot see the
model. The Fit function is also available from the VM View toolbar.

When the current focus is on the Controller Time-Line window, the Fit
function will adjust the scale of the time line so that the entire
process is visible.

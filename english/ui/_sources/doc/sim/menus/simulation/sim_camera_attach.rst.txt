Simulation»Camera»Attach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Attaches the camera to the currently selected object. If no object is
selected, the camera is attached to the world coordinate system (this is
the default). When the camera is attached to an object, the camera moves
with the object. Standard viewpoints are always in relation to the
attached object. The camera can also be attached to an object using the
right-mouse “Attach Camera” context menu on that object. The camera can
be detached by doing the same in the background. A checkmark in the menu
indicates that the camera is attached to an object.

Simulation»Camera»Pivot (Ctrl+P)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Camera Pivot function sets the center of rotation for the camera to
the center of the currently selected object. The pivot center is the
point in space at which the camera will aim as it is rotated. If no
object is selected, then the camera will rotate about the center of the
world coordinate system (i.e., the center of the three grids).

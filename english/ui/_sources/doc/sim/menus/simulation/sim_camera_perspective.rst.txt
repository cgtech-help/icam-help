Simulation»Camera»Perspective
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Switches between Perspective and Orthogonal projection in the simulation
window. The Perspective projection provides a more realistic viewing of
the simulation, equivalent to what you would see in the natural world.
With Orthogonal projection, distance has no effect on the size of an
object. Orthogonal views typically provide better control when defining
part, stock and fixture objects.

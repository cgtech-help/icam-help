Simulation»Construct Axis»Head Axis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creates a head axis, given an XYZ origin and head reference type. Head
axes can define the location on the machine where exchangeable heads are
mounted; positions on or around the machine where heads are stored when
not in use; or anywhere else where heads might be attached.

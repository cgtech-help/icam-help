Activates a standard file dialog to select the name of the Verification
Setup (.vsw) file to use for simulation. The setup file contains
settings for lighting, grid, camera, viewpoints, etc. The setup file

which contains the part, stock and fixture definitions. Typically, each
NC program input file will have an associated setup and 3D model file.

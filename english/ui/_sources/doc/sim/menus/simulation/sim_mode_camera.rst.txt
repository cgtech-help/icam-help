Simulation»Mode»Camera
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the Camera mode menu bar selection is active, holding the
left-mouse button down while moving the mouse changes the orientation of
the camera. The cursor appears as a four-way arrow when in Camera mode.
This mode can also be activated by selecting the circled button in the
VM Mode toolbar above. While in Camera mode, you can press and hold the
Ctrl key to temporarily switch to Selection mode. This can be used to
quickly select objects to rotate about or to attach the camera to.

There are two types of camera rotation.

#. The default rotation is to keep the camera position fixed but to
   change where the camera is aimed. This is similar to how we rotate
   our head to look around a scene.
#. You can hold the Shift key to change how the camera rotates. When
   Shift is pressed, the camera rotates around a point in space. This
   rotation point is by default the center of the world or the selected
   VM Grid object, but can be changed by selecting any object and
   choosing Simulation»Camera»Pivot (Ctrl P). As a quick shortcut,
   double-clicking an object in a simulation window will set that object
   as the Pivot center and fit the object in the window.

If you prefer the second form of camera rotation by default, clear the
“Default to Look-Around camera” check-box in the Simulation»Options
(Ctrl Alt O) dialog.

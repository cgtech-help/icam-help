The View Angle»Increase and View Angle»Decrease menu selections (Shift +
and Shift – shortcuts) adjust the viewing angle of the camera lens. Each
activation of the menu will only adjust the viewing angle by one notch,
so it is far more convenient to use the shortcut keys. The viewing angle
is used in Perspective mode only.

When adjusting the angle, a viewing angle size indicator will appear
briefly in the simulation window.

The default viewing angle is 45 degrees. Increasing the viewing angle
makes it possible to see more of the model, at the expense of some
distortion. Decreasing the viewing angle makes it possible to look at
the model in fine detail, but makes it a little harder to navigate.

The Invert Hide State function reverses the “hidden” state setting for
all objects in the *currently active* simulation window. Objects that
are hidden will now be shown; those are shown will now be hidden. You
can use this feature to unhide one or more selected objects, as follows:

-  Type Ctrl Shift B to show just the hidden (and any selected) objects
-  Select the objects you no longer want hidden
-  Type Ctrl B to remove them from view
-  Type Ctrl Shift B to return back to the original display

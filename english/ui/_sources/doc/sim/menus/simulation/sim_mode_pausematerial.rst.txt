Simulation»Mode»Pause Material Removal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the "Pause Material Removal" selection is active, the in-process
stock and machinable fixtures will not be affected by the cutting action
of the tool. This function temporarily disables material removal
simulation (MRS). This MRS setting can also be toggled by selecting
button in the VM Mode toolbar.

Temporarily inhibiting MRS can be useful to ignore further invalid
cutting actions of a tool, during the early simulation phase of a
manufacturing program. Also, when used with Run»Restart (Shift F5) a
program can be quickly run once without MRS, and if necessary a second
time with MRS following the restart, without having to change the
"Enable Material Removal Simulation" setting in the launch panel VM
pane.

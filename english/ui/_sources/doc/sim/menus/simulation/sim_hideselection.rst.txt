The Hide in View function makes the currently selected object or objects
invisible in the *currently active* simulation window. Compare this to
the Hide in All Views function below. Once an object is hidden, it is no
longer shown in the simulation window.

To select an object, press and hold the Ctrl key (if you are in Camera
mode), move the mouse pointer to the object to be selected, then press
the left-mouse button. The selected object will become transparent. You
can deselect an already selected object, or add more objects to the list
of selected ones, by holding the Shift key down when making a selection.
Press Ctrl B to make the selected objects invisible.

In the image shown above, the machine enclosure has been hidden (it is
longer visible), and the tables and fixtures have been selected (they
are shown transparent). Hiding and selecting are two methods you can use
to get an unobstructed view of the manufacturing process.

The Hide in All Views function makes the currently selected object or
objects invisible in *all* of the simulation windows. Compare this to

The Grid Dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image1| The Grid dialog defines the boundaries and appearance of the
world. The Reset button resets the grid appearance and size to
reasonable values.

Grid Units can be set to any convenient value and need not match the
units used when the model was created. For optimal display and control,
the grid dimensions (Min/Max grid value) should exceed the dimensions of
the model itself. The Grid subdivision size defines the spacing of the
grid, for visual clarity only (excessively small spacing can greatly
increase the CPU requirements during scene rendering). The Snap to grid
check box and associated input field define a rounding factor that can
optionally be used when interactively constructing objects using the
mouse pointer.

Select Grid color to set the color of the grid lines (the background
color is set using the SimulationÂ»Options dialog).

The main axis (model origin), grid contour boundary and grid subdivision
lines can all be toggled visible or invisible using the Display Show
check boxes.

The coordinate frame marker size, color and style can also be controlled
from the Grid dialog. The three horizontal sliders in the Dimensions
area control the size of the arrow. Colors for each axis of the marker
can be set in the Colors area. The arrow style can be set using the
Arrow type selection.

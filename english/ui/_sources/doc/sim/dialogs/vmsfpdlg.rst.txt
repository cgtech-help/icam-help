The Parts/Fixtures Dialog |image1|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This dialog provides the ability to add rough stock, fixtures and final
parts to the simulation.

This information is stored in a 3D model (.m3d) file, in the same
directory and with the same name as the verification setup (.vsw) file.
These two files are automatically saved when the program is completed.
They will be reused on subsequent runs to quickly reestablish the
material conditions necessary for an accurate simulation.

Parts can be composed of both a rough stock, used for material removal
simulation, and the design part, to which it can be compared using the
Simulation»Compare (Ctrl Alt Q) function. Fixtures can be composed of
both machinable and non-machinable components. See `Differences between
Part, Stock and Fixture
Components <../other/vmaddingpartfixtstock.html#psf>`__ for a more
detailed description of how each of these object types are used by VM.
In brief:

-  **Part»Stock**: Represents the uncut material at the start of an
   operation. Stock definitions are ignored for collision testing
   purposes unless running with the Material Removal Simulation (MRS)
   license option enabled.
-  **Part»Design**: Represents the final shape expected to be produced.
   Collision testing is always enabled, with an additional allowable
   gouge tolerance on the cutting portion of the tool.
-  **Fixture**: Represents the part holding device. Two forms of
   collision testing are enabled, depending on whether the fixture is
   machinable or not.

Objects are maintained in two lists, accessible by selecting one of the
Part or Fixture tabs at the upper left corner of the dialog. For each
type, a navigator along the left hand side of the dialog lists all of
the objects defined for that specific type. For example, a fixture might
consist of many parts, such as a base plate, clamps, spacers and so on.
Select Import to bring in the part and fixture definitions from a
different part program. Select Export to save the current part and
fixture definitions to a named file for use in a different part program.

Select the top entry in the navigator to see list of objects for the
selected type. Select New followed by New Part or New Fixture to create
a new object. The object's name is used by VM when reporting collision
diagnostics. The object's current axis defines the stock axis (or
mounting point) where the object will be attached to the machine model
at the start of the program. Machine models with multiple tables or
pallets may define multiple stock axes. Click on an entry in the table
to change the object's name, its default axis (used when the program
starts) or the current axis (the association in force at this point in
the program). Setting the current axis value to "None" removes the part
or fixture from the simulation, but not from the list of objects. You
can select one or more objects in the right hand list and press the
Delete button to completely remove them.

|image2| Each object can consist of one or more physical components,
which are listed when you select an object name in the left hand list
box, or when you select an object in the right hand object list and
press the Modify button. Each component of an object can be given a
name, which will be reported during collision diagnostics (e.g., "KHL
146 LH"). Fixture components can be tagged as machinable or not. Part
components are never machinable; stock components are ignored for
collision testing purposes.

Select the New button to add a new component. The following component
types can be added:

-  **Cube**: Defines a cubic (i.e., box) entity given the XYX
   coordinates of one corner and the width, length and height (XYZ).
-  **Cylinder**: Defines a cylindrical or conical entity given an XYZ
   coordinate of the center, an initial radius, a final radius and the
   overall height. The surface of the cylinder is approximated by a
   number of faces, which can be specified. The light rendering at the
   edg-es between faces can be set smooth or sharp, allowing shapes like
   a hexagon to be defined.
-  **Cone**: Defines a conical entity given an XYZ coordinate of the
   center, an initial radius, a final radius and the overall height. The
   Cone and Cylinder definitions are identical; they differ during
   construction only.
-  **Sphere**: Defines a spherical entity given an XYZ coordinate of the
   center and a radius. The surface of the sphere is approximated by a
   number of faces, which can be controlled by the subdivision size (0
   produces a 20 face icosahedron and each increase in subdivision value
   increases the faces by a factor of 3). The light rendering at the
   edges between faces can be set smooth or sharp.
-  **Import STL**: Imports an STL file relative to a specified XYZ
   location in the model.

Components are created interactively in the simulation window. The
various Hide... checkboxes can be selected to reduce the visual clutter
in the simulation window during component creation. When a component is
being created, its type and required parameters are listed at the bottom
of the simulation window. You can enter the parameters using the
keyboard, or you can move the mouse to an appropriate position and click
the left-mouse button. Each click of the mouse can supply values for one
or two parameters. You can change the camera position, standard view or
user-defined viewpoint at any time. Use the Tab key and Shift-Tab key to
move forwards and back through the required parameters to make changes.
When creating new objects with the mouse, the pointer might be locked to
a fixed grid size. You can temporarily toggle the grid setting by
pressing the Shift key. Select Simulation»Grid (Ctrl Alt G) to make
changes to the default grid.

Existing objects can be selected from the component list and modified by
pressing the Modify button, or removed from the object by pressing the
Delete button.

When the Material Removal Simulation (MRS) license option is enabled,
stock and machinable fixture components can be enabled or disabled for
MRS simulation using the object's Material Removal column setting. The
MRS in-process stock result can be compared to the design part using the
Simulation»Compare (Ctrl Alt Q) and Simulation»Show»Filters»Boolean...
functions. The in-process stock result can also be automatically saved
at the end of processing by specifying an Output file for each stock
component.

When running VM with a Manufacturing Extractor, the association between
stock and design part will automatically be set, and stock will be
enabled for MRS and output at completion.

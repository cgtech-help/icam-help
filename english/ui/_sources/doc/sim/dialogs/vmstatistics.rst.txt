The Statistics Dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Simulation Statistics dialog offers to the user a list of all
components in the simulation as well as useful information that can be
used to debug macros or investigate simulation performance bottleneck.
The runtime and model builder offer slightly different information as
described bellow.

|    the model.                                                         |
| -  **Nb of channels** indicates how many channel are defined in the   |
|    model.                                                             |
| -  **Nb of tools** indicates the number of tools defined in the       |
|    current simulation.                                                |
| -  **Nb of heads** indicates the number of heads defined in the       |
|    current simulation.                                                |
| -  **Nb of parts** indicates the number of parts defined in the       |
|    current simulation.                                                |

| **List of components**                                                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| This list show all the component currently defined in the simulation  |
| as well as extra information and statistics about each of them. Note  |
| that some informations like Component ID and Parent ID are only       |
| available at runtime as they are dynamic properties not available     |
| during model creation.                                                |
|                                                                       |
| -  **ID** The component ID as returned by $FMSID.                     |
| -  **Name** The component name as returned by $FMSIDN.                |
| -  **Active** Yes if the Component is actually taking part in the     |
|    simulation.                                                        |
| -  **Parent ID** The component parent’s ID as returned by $FMSID.     |
| -  **Type** The component type and it’s numerical value as returned   |
|    by $FMSIDT.                                                        |
| -  **Sub Type** The component sub type when applicable.               |
| -  **Collide** Yes if the component is an entity tested for           |
|    collision. No if it is a visual only entity. NA if the component   |
|    is not an entity (ex: tool axis).                                  |
| -  **Safety** Yes if the component tested for collision that also     |
|    have a safety zone. No if the component is tested for collision    |
|    but do not have safety zone. NA if the component is not an entity  |
|    and thus cannot have a safety zone.                                |
| -  **Triangles** Number of triangles of the mesh if the component is  |
|    an entity. NA if the component is not an entity.                   |
| -  Safety Triangles Number of triangles of the safety mesh if the     |
|    component is an entity with safety. 0 if no safety zone. NA if the |
|    component is not an entity.                                        |
| -  **Total triangles** Total number of triangles for the entity. This |
|    includes entity mesh triangles and safety mesh triangles.          |
| -  **%** Percentage of the simulation total triangle count the entity |
|    is using. NA if the component is not an entity.                    |

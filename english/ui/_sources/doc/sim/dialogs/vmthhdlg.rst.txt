The Tools/Holders/Heads Dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This dialog provides the ability to add **tool** and associated
**holder** definitions to the simulation, as well as to select the
active **head** on a machine that supports multiple head attachments.
The term “Holder” is used by VM to refer to a device that securely holds
the tool in the spindle. The term “Head” is used by VM to refer to an
exchangeable head (e.g., a right angle head attachment).

-  `Tools tab <#tools>`__
-  `Holders tab <#holders>`__
-  `Heads tab <#heads>`__

Tool and holder definitions are automatically saved in the verification
setup (.vsw) file when the program is completed. This setup file will be
reused on subsequent runs to quickly reestablish the tooling necessary
for an accurate simulation. Tool and holder definitions from another
part program can be imported into the current session by pressing the
Import button and then selecting the verification setup (.vsw) file of
the other part program.

Tooling definitions, like fixture and part definitions, are not a
required element for simulation, but if used they add to simulation
accuracy and realism. VM attaches solid model representations of holders
and tools to the spindle control point (SCP). Once attached, they become
a part of the collision detection process.

The left side of the dialog lists the known tools, holders and heads.
Heads are defined in the model and the sole purpose of this dialog is to
select the active head (see “Heads” below). The middle section of the
tool/holder dialog contains the various controls that allow for the
creation and modification of tools and holders. The right side of the
tool/holder dialog has two viewing panes that are dynamically updated to
reflect modifications done in the center section.

-  The upper right pane is the construction view. Depending on the type
   of tool or holder, this can either be in a 2D or 3D view format. For
   the 2D format, hold the left-mouse button down to pan the view, hold
   and release the right-mouse button to zoom to a selected region, and
   use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Double-click in the view to
   reset the zoom factor to make the tool or holder fully visible. The
   standard VM controls apply for navigating a 3D view.
-  The lower right pane is a 3D assembly preview centered on the tool or
   holder. The standard VM controls apply for navigating a 3D view.
   Holding and then releasing the left-mouse while moving horizontally
   will impart a spin on the object; click once in the window to remove
   the spin. The right-mouse pop-up context menu provides additional
   functions to aid in viewing the tool or holder.

|image1| Some tool and holder definitions are identified as being
“Generic”, which means that the tool or holder shape is defined using an
STL mesh. These are added to the tool and holder definitions using the
same Mesh Component dialog as is used in QUEST to import machine
components into the model. From this dialog, you can specify the name of
the STL mesh component, its position and orientation in space and its
material color properties. An Import button on the dialog is used to
specify the STL file to read and the units of measure of the STL object.
A Scale button on the dialog can be used to change the size of the
imported object if required. The Keep as an external reference setting
saves a reference to the STL in the verification setup (.vsw) file
instead of the object itself. Note that the Collision detection options
are not available since tools and holders are always tested for exact
collision.

When exiting the Tools/Holders/Heads dialog, VM will validate the tool
and holder dimensions against the Controller window tool and diameter
compensation amounts. If the tool compensation amounts do not agree with
the tool definitions, a dialog will appear listing suggested tool
compensation changes highlighted in blue. Selecting OK will
automatically adjust the tool compensation for selected tools.

| When running VM with a Manufacturing Extractor, tools and holders will
  be automatically created to match those used in the CAM manufacturing
  program.

Tools
~~~~~

Select the Tools tab to add, modify or delete tool definitions. Select
the New button to define a new tool. Select an existing tool definition
to modify that tool. Select one or more tools and press the Delete
button to remove the selected tools.

The following tool types are available:

-  :ref:`Lathe <lathetooltype>`
-  :ref:`Mill <milltooltype>`
-  :ref:`Probe <probetooltype>`
-  :ref:`Additive <additivetooltype>`

The tool table lists the following information for each tool:

-  **ID:** Identifies the tool using the native form of tool numbering
   on the controller.
-  **Type:** Lists the tool type as defined when the tool was created or
   last modified.
-  **Unit:** Shows the units of measure used for non-angular tool
   dimensions.
-  **Lock:** GENER will automatically define a default milling or
   drilling tool if a tool definition does not exist for the one being
   loaded. GENER uses the APT CUTTER command to define the shape of the
   tool. Tools defined in this way have a cutting length equal to the
   total tool length, and do not have a shank or associated holder.
   Automatically created tools are by default “unlocked” (i.e., the Lock
   state is “No”); meaning that their definition will change each time a
   CUTTER command is encountered. Any tool that is created manually or
   that is subsequently modified is set locked (i.e., the Lock state is
   “Yes”) so that these modifications will not be overridden. CERUN does
   not have the ability to automatically define tools. Double-click on
   this field to change the locked state of a tool.
-  **Default pocket:** Primarily used when simulating tool changers on
   models that define tool pocket locations. Double click on this field
   to choose the pocket where the tool will reside.
-  **Current pocket:** The current location of the tool. This field is
   updated dynamically by VM as tools are loaded. You can manually
   insert a tool into the spindle by double clicking on this field and
   selecting the primary tool axis.

Individual tool definitions include the above properties, as well as the
following ones that are common to most tools:

-  **Holder:** Lists zero or more holders for the tool. The tool is
   attached to the lowest holder in the list, and each holder in the
   list is attached to the one above it, with the topmost holder in the
   list being attached to the model’s spindle control point. To add a
   holder, double-click an empty line in the list, and then type the
   holder name or select one from the drop-list. To modify a holder,
   select an existing holder in the list and enter the new holder name.
   The order of holders can be rearranged by dragging and dropping. Use
   the Delete key to remove selected holders from the list. Holder names
   are listed in red if the holder has not yet been defined.
-  **Usage:** Specifies the intended use of the tool, which can be one
   of “Finishing”, “Semi-Finishing” or “Roughing”. A tool’s intended
   usage affects the in-process stock machining tolerance when the
   Material Removal Simulation (MRS) option is enabled. A “finishing”
   tool will use the gouge tolerance for MRS simulation; a
   “semi-finishing” tool will use a 5 times coarser tolerance; and a
   “roughing” tool will use a 10 times coarser tolerance. The gouge
   tolerance amount is defined in the Simulation»Options dialog
   Tolerances tab. Manufacturing Extractors will set the tool usage if
   this information is available from the CAM system, otherwise the
   usage will be set to Finishing.
-  **Cut Color:** Specifies the normal cutting color to use with the
   selected tool on the in-process stock when the Material Removal
   Simulation (MRS) option is enabled. The selection drop-down provides
   “Auto”, “Custom” and “Stock” choices. The “Auto” selection will
   automatically assign a color (from a pallet of 12 basic colors) to
   the tool each time it is loaded. The “Custom” selection allows any
   color to be chosen from a standard color picker. The “Stock”
   selection will use the actual stock color instead of a special color.

.. _lathetooltype:

Lathe Tool Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Select “Lathe” as the tool type to define a turning tool insert/holder
combination. The following lathe insert types can be defined:

-  **Round**: A round or circular insert.
-  **Trigon**: A three cornered insert resembling a triangle, but with
   an intermediate angle on the sides, to allow for a higher included
   angles at the tips.
-  **Diamond**: A four-sided insert with two acute angles.
-  **Symmetrical**: Any “n” equal sided insert.
-  **Thread**: A three cornered threading insert, with a tooth shape on
   each corner.

   threading, grooving or cut-off.
-  **Profile**: An insert defined by a 2D profile.
-  **Generic**: An insert defined by an STL mesh.

Inserts are defined in the ZX plane of the machine. The blue dotted line
represents the positive Z-axis of the machine. The red dotted line
represents the positive X-axis of the machine. Tool path traces are
drawn originating from the center point of the fillet radius of the
insert. Currently, tool nose compensation is only available from the
center of the insert nose (i.e., P0 or P9 type compensation) and not
from the theoretical tool tip.

All turning tools have the following settings:

-  **Units**: The unit of measure for non-angular values. Angles are
   always measured in degrees.

   on the controller.
-  **Left/Right hand**: Controls how the insert is mated with the
   holder.
-  **Colors**: Defines the display color of the lathe insert tool. When
   the MRS license option is enabled, the Cut selection defines the
   color to show the cutting action of the tool on the in-process stock.
   See the `Cut Color <#cutcolor>`__ description above for more
   information.
-  **Usage**: Specifies the intended use of the tool, which can be one
   of “Finishing”, “Semi-Finishing” or “Roughing”. A tool’s intended
   usage affects the in-process stock machining tolerance when the
   Material Removal Simulation (MRS) option is enabled. See the
   `Usage <#usage>`__ description above for more information.
-  **Holder**: Lists zero or more holders for the tool. See the
   `Holder <#holder>`__ description above for more information.

The Round, Trigon, Diamond, Symmetrical, Thread and Groove turning tools
have one or more additional parameters follows:

The Profile turning tool has a different set of parameters, as follows:

-  **Cutting profile**: Defines the outer edge of the insert as a 2D ZX
   axes profile, with one set of coordinates per line. An R value
   defines an arc with given radius tangent to the profile segments that
   immediately precede and follow it. The right-mouse context menu can
   be used to insert and remove points from the table.
-  **ZX Offset**: Defines the offset from the contour origin to the
   holder mating point.
-  **Height (h)**: The height of the insert.
-  **Clearance angle (a)**: The relief angle of the insert.

Finally, the Generic turning tool is defined as follows:

-  **Name**: A 3D STL shape defining the insert. For material removal
   purposes, the insert will be intersected along the cutting plane and
   the resultant 2D shape used for MRS calculations.
-  Select the **Mesh button** to modify the mesh properties (see the
   `Mesh dialog <#mesh>`__ description above).
-  **Tool mounting offset**: Defines the offset from the STL origin to
   the holder mating point.

.. _milltooltype:

   STL meshes.

Milling tools, with the exception of Generic, are all defined in a 2D
profile view. The blue dotted line represents the positive Z-axis of the
machine. The red dotted line represents the positive X-axis of the
machine. Tool path traces are drawn originating from the center bottom
tip of the tool.

All milling tools have the following settings:

-  **Units**: The unit of measure for non-angular values. Angles are
   always measured in degrees.
-  **ID**: Identifies the tool using the native form of tool numbering
   on the controller.
-  **Number of flutes (n)**: Defines the number of cutting teeth, edges,
   inserts or flutes on the tool.
-  **Left/Right hand**: Defines the cutting direction.
-  **Colors**: Defines the display colors for the shank (if used), body
   and cutting portions of the tool. When the MRS license option is
   enabled, the Cut selection defines the color to show the cutting
   action of the tool on the in-process stock. See the `Cut
   Color <#cutcolor>`__ description above for more information.
-  **Usage**: Specifies the intended use of the tool, which can be one
   of “Finishing”, “Semi-Finishing” or “Roughing”. A tool’s intended
   usage affects the in-process stock machining tolerance when the
   Material Removal Simulation (MRS) option is enabled. See the
   `Usage <#usage>`__ description above for more information.
-  **Holder**: Lists zero or more holders for the tool. See the
   `Holder <#holder>`__ description above for more information.

The End mill, Ball nose, Bull nose, Drill and APT 7 milling tools have
one or more additional parameters follows:

-  **Tool diameter (d)**: The diameter of the cutting portion of the
   tool, measured at the intersection of the bottom and sides of the
   tool.
-  **Cutter length (l)**: The total length of the tool from bottom tip
   to the mating point (TCP) of the holder, or if not using holders, to
   the spindle control point (SCP).
-  **Flute length (fl)**: The cutting length of the tool, measured from
   the bottom tip.
-  **Corner radius (cr)**: The corner radius of the tool. Not applicable
   for end mills (whose corner radius is zero), ball nose end mills
   (whose corner radius is ½ the diameter), or for drills.
-  **Bottom angle (ba)**: The angle of the bottom cutting edge of the
   tool. The angle must be zero or larger. Only applicable for drills
   and APT 7 cutter types.
-  **Side angle (sa)**: The angle of the side cutting edge of the tool.
   The angle can be positive or negative. Only applicable for APT 7
   cutter types.
-  **Body offset (o)**: Defines the relief on the tool diameter to apply
   to the cutter body portion of the tool.
-  **Set shank**: Select this checkbox to define the shank of the tool
   extending above the mating point with the holder or spindle.
-  **Shank length (sl)**: The length of the shank.
-  **Shank diameter (sd)**: The diameter of the shank.

The Profile milling tool has a different set of parameters, as follows:

-  **Cutting**: Defines the radial and axial coordinates of the cutting
   tool profile, with one set of coordinates per line. An R value
   defines an arc with given radius tangent to the profile segments that
   immediately precede and follow it. Only define the right half profile
   of the tool (i.e., zero or positive radial values only). Positive
   axial values are measured downwards, from the mating point of the
   holder (TCP) or spindle face (SCP) towards the bottom tip of the
   tool. The right-mouse context menu can be used to insert and remove
   points from the table, and to insert a “delimiter” line that
   separates the list into multiple distinct cutting profiles.
-  **Non-Cutting**: Defines the radial and axial coordinates of the
   non-cutting tool profile, in the same fashion as described above for
   the cutting profile.
-  **Body offset (o)**: Defines the relief on the tool diameter to apply
   to the non-cutting profiles portion of the tool.

Finally, the Generic milling tool is defined as follows:

-  **Tool mesh components**: Defines one or more cutting and non-cutting
   mesh components of the tool. Use the right-mouse context menu to
   “Import” a mesh from an STL file (see the `Mesh dialog <#mesh>`__
   description above) or to select a lathe tool insert already defined
   in the tool table. Once loaded, the Dup column defines the number of
   instances of the mesh to be equally spaced around the tool center and
   the Angle column specifies an angular XY plane offset. For material
   removal purposes, meshes indicated as cutting (i.e., with the Cut
   column selected) will be revolved around the tool center and the
   resultant 3D shape used for MRS calculations. The right-mouse context
   menu can be used to insert and remove meshes from the table, and to
   modify the properties of individual meshes. The order that the meshes
   are listed in the table is not important.
-  **Tool mounting offset**: Defines the xyz offset from the tool tip to
   the tool origin (holder mating point).


.. _probetooltype:

Probe Tool Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Select Probe as the tool type to define a straight or star stylus probe:

-  **Straight**: A probe with a single straight stylus.
-  **Star**: A probe with a multi-tip star stylus (5 balls).

When a probe tool is loaded, VM is aware that it is a probe and that it
cannot be used for cutting. VM has macro functions and variables that
can be used to query the results of a probe touch.

Probe tools are all defined in a 2D profile view. The blue dotted line
represents the positive Z-axis of the machine. The red dotted line
represents the positive X-axis of the machine. Tool path traces are
drawn originating from the center bottom tip of the probe.

All probe tools have the following settings:

-  **Units**: The unit of measure for non-angular values. Angles are
   always measured in degrees.
-  **ID**: Identifies the tool using the native form of tool numbering
   on the controller.
-  **Stylus length (sl)**: The total length of the probe from the center
   of the bottom ball to the mating point (TCP) of the holder, or if not
   using holders, to the spindle control point (SCP).
-  **Stylus diameter (sd)**: The diameter of the stylus.
-  **Probe radius (r)**: The radius of the probe ball.
-  **Colors**: Defines the display colors for the stylus (the “Base”)
   and ball (the “Probe”) portions of the probe tool.
-  **Holder**: Lists zero or more holders for the tool. Probe tools
   define just the stylus; the probe body can be defined as a holder to
   which the stylus is then attached. See the `Holder <#holder>`__
   description above for more information.

The Star probe tool has the following additional parameters:

-  **Height (h)**: The height of the horizontal 4-ball star section,
   measured from the center of the bottom ball to the center of the star
   section balls.
-  **Width (w)**: The distance from the center of the probe tool to the
   center of the star section balls.


.. _additivetooltype:

Additive Tool Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Select “Additive” as the tool type to define a hybrid additive
manufacturing (AM) tool or device. The following AM tool types can be
defined:

-  **Profile**: A tool defined by revolved 2D profiles of the body and
   additive material regions.
-  **Generic**: A tool defined by one or more body and additive STL
   meshes.

The Profile AM tool is defined as follows:

-  **Body**: Defines the radial and axial coordinates of the AM tool
   body profile, with one set of coordinates per line. An R value
   defines an arc with given radius tangent to the profile segments that
   immediately precede and follow it. Only define the right half profile
   of the tool (i.e., zero or positive radial values only). Positive
   axial values are measured downwards, from the mating point of the
   holder (TCP) or spindle face (SCP) towards the bottom tip of the
   tool. The right-mouse context menu can be used to insert and remove
   points from the table, and to insert a “delimiter” line that
   separates the list into multiple distinct body profiles.
-  **Additive**: Defines the radial and axial coordinates of the
   additive material profile, in the same fashion as described above for
   the body profile (only a single profile is supported). The AM profile
   defines the shape of the material that will be added to the
   in-process stock when the AM tool is loaded and activated.
-  **Z Offset (z)**: Defines the offset from the point in space where
   the tool-path trace will be drawn to the tool origin (holder mating
   point). This also affects the suggested length compensation amounts.

The Generic AM tool is defined as follows:

-  **Name**: Defines additive material (AM) and body mesh components of
   the tool. Only one mesh component can be additive, as indicated by
   selecting the AM check box. The AM mesh defines the shape of the
   material that will be added to the in-process stock when the AM tool
   is loaded and activated.
-  Select the **Mesh button** to modify the mesh properties (see the
   `Mesh dialog <#mesh>`__ description above).
-  **XYZ Offset**: Defines the offset from the point in space where the
   tool-path trace will be drawn to the tool origin (holder mating
   point). This also affects the suggested length compensation amounts.

Holders
~~~~~~~

Holder definitions add to simulation accuracy and realism. VM attaches
solid model representations of holders and tools to the spindle control
point (SCP). Once attached, they become a part of the collision
detection process. Holders are associated with tools using the Tools
dialog.

Note that the term “Holder” is used by VM to refer to a device used to
securely hold the tool in the spindle. The term “Head” is used by VM to
refer to detachable spindle units (e.g., a right angle head attachment).
The GENER HEAD keyword on a LOAD or TOOLNO command refers to a head
attachment, not the tool holder.

Select the Holders tab to add, modify or delete holder definitions.
Select the New button to define a new holder. Select an existing holder
definition to modify that holder. Select one or more holder and press
the Delete button to remove the selected holder.

The following holder types are available:

-  :ref:`Profile <profileholdertype>`
-  :ref:`Generic <genericholdertype>`

The holder table lists the following information for each holder:

-  **Name**: The name of the holder.
-  **Type**: Identifies the sub-type of the holder as being Profile (a
   holder defined by a 2D profile revolved about the spindle axis) or
   Generic (a holder defined by one or more STL meshes).
-  **Unit**: Defines the units of measure for non-angular holder
   dimensions.


.. _profileholdertype:

Profile Holder Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Select “Profile” as the holder type to define a cylindrical holder by a
2D profile that will be swept around the spindle axis. A 2D profile
holder is defined as follows:

-  **Holder**: The name of the holder. This name must be used in a tool
   definition to reference the holder.
-  **Units**: The unit of measure for profile and contact coordinates.
-  **Contact point**: Defines how the holder is attached to the machine
   and tool models. The Spindle contact point is aligned with the
   machine SCP (spindle control point) or the TCP of another parent
   holder. The Tool contact point identifies where the top of the tool
   or the SCP of another child holder is aligned.
-  **Color**: Defines the display color for the holder body.
-  **Act as a head**: Select this checkbox if the holder offset between
   spindle (SCP) and tool (TCP) is not included in the tool length
   compensation settings on the machine. This affects the tool length
   validation calculation as described `above <#compensation>`__.
-  **Profile**: Defines the radial and axial coordinates of the holder
   profile, with one set of coordinates per line. An R value defines an
   arc with given radius tangent to the profile segments that
   immediately precede and follow it. Only define the right half profile
   of the holder (i.e., zero or positive radial values only). Positive
   axial values are measured downward, from the spindle face (SCP) or
   mating point of a parent holder (TCP), towards the bottom tip of the
   holder. The right-mouse context menu can be used to insert and remove
   points from the table.


.. _genericholdertype:

Generic Holder Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Select “Generic” as the holder type to define a holder defined by one or
more STL mesh components. A generic holder is defined as follows:

-  **Holder**: The name of the holder. This name must be used in a tool
   definition to reference the holder.
-  **Units**: The unit of measure for contact coordinates.
-  **Contact point**: Defines how the holder is attached to the machine
   and tool models. The Spindle XYZ contact point is aligned with the
   machine SCP (spindle control point) or the TCP of another holder. The
   Tool XYZ contact point identifies where the top of the tool or the
   SCP of another holder is aligned. The Rotate XYZ angles define the
   orientation of tool as mounted in the holder.
-  **Act as a head**: Select this checkbox if the holder offset between
   spindle (SCP) and tool (TCP) is not included in the tool length
   compensation settings on the machine. This affects the tool length
   validation calculation as described `above <#compensation>`__.
-  **Internally geared**: Select this checkbox if the holder itself does
   not rotate, but instead transmits the spindle rotation force
   internally from the spindle contact point to the tool contact point.
   You can then specify a signed spindle ratio that defines the effect
   internal gearing (if any) has on the tool.
-  **Mesh components**: Defines one or more mesh components of the
   holder. Use the right-mouse context menu to “Import” a mesh from an
   STL file (see the `Mesh dialog <#mesh>`__ description above). The
   right-mouse context menu can be used to insert and remove meshes from
   the table, and to modify the properties of individual meshes. The
   order that the meshes are listed in the table is not important. The
   XYZ values in the table list the position of the mesh as described
   below.

| Use the four view buttons along the top edge of the construction pane
  to change the construction view orientation. The red/green/blue dotted
  lines show the zero-point origin of the holder. A tool-axis kinematics
  marker shows the mating point of the holder with the SCP of the
  machine (or the TCP of a parent holder). A solid red/green/blue axis
  marker shows where and at what orientation the tool will be mounted to
  the holder (the TCP).

--------------

Heads
~~~~~

A head is a removable device that attaches to the machine and which
provides some form of extended machining capability. Common examples of
such devices are 90 degree angled heads that mount the tool at an angle,
long reach heads that extend the Z axis travel of the tool and heads
with one or more controllable rotary axes that provide 4 or 5-axis
control of the tool. Head devices (there can be multiple heads) are
predefined in the model.

The Head Definition tab is used to establish where the head devices are
currently located in the model space and which head device is currently
active. Heads can be parked at designated stations near the machine, and
automatically loaded and unloaded by VM in the same way that tools are
automatically loaded and unloaded. The Head Definition tab provides
manual control over the placement of heads in the same way that the Tool
Definition tab provides manual control over tools. The table lists the
following information for each head defined in the model:

-  **ID**: Identifies the head using the native form of head numbering
   on the controller.
-  **Name**: Identifies the head using the name assigned by the creator
   of the VM model.
-  **Current station**: The current location of the head. This field is
   updated dynamically by VM as heads are loaded. You can manually load
   or park a head by double clicking on this field and selecting a head
   attachment point from the drop-down list.

Head attachment points are defined in the model with QUEST using the
Simulation»Construct Axis»Head axis menu selection (see description on
page 119). Only one head at a time can reside at any single head
attachment point.

A head must be attached to the machine (actually, to a head axis
identified as a “head socket”) for it to be active.

Heads do not have to be visible in the model. A head will not be shown
if its current selected station is “None”.

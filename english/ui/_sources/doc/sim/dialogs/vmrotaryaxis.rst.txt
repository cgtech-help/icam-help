The Rotary Axis Property Dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image1| Defines a rotary axis, given an XYZ origin and the direction
vector and range of interpolation.

-  **Rotation axis:** The axis about which the rotation occurs. Standard
   rotations have the A, B and C axes rotating about the X, Y and Z axes
   respectively. Rotary axes that move the tool (e.g., rotary heads)
   typically have a standard positive direction, and those that move the
   part (e.g., rotary tables) have a negative (reversed) direction. For
   example, rotating the part in a CCLW direction has the effect of
   moving the tool in a CLW direction with respect to the part. Select
   “Custom” if the rotary axis does not rotate around one of the major
   axes. When Custom is selected, you must enter a Custom rotation
   vector, which defines the X, Y and Z-axis vector components of the
   axis of rotation, using the “right hand rule”. Using your right hand,
   point your thumb in the direction of the vector; your fingers curl in
   the direction of positive rotation.
-  **Use range validation:** Clear this check box if the rotary axis has
   unlimited physical travel.
-  **Spindle definition:** Select the “This rotary axis connects to a
   spindle” check box if the rotary axis can double as a spindle. This
   is common for mill/turn lathes, where the spindle can freely rotate
   when turning but then be interpolated as a rotary axis when milling.
   VM uses the Spindle ID to differentiate between the different
   spindles that might be available on a machine. Once defined, a
   spindle can be later mapped as a milling or turning spindle using the
   Axes mapping tab page of the machine properties dialog. Ratio can be
   specified if the spindle rotation is not 1:1.
-  **Turret definition:** Select the “This rotary axis is used as a
   turret” check box if the rotary axis defines the rotation of a lathe
   tool turret. VM uses the Turret number to differentiate between the
   different turrets that might be available on a machine. Turret number
   1 should be used for the main turret. Turret number 2 should be used
   for a second turret if one exists. The Positioning field is used by
   VM to position the turrets as tools are loaded. With Automatic
   positioning, the turret is expected to have the available tool slots
   equally distributed around the perimeter. Use Predefined positioning
   and select the Set positions button to define the turret rotation
   angle for each of the available tool slots.
-  **Label offset:** Defines the offset of the informational kinematics
   marker along the rotation axis. Kinematics markers can be enabled or
   disabled using the VM Grid tool bar.

When defining a rotary axis with a Custom orientation, you can enter the
custom rotation vector, or you can use a standard orientation and use
the Rotate button to orient the axis. Both methods produce identical
kinematics, but the Rotate method has the side effect of changing the
XYZ reference coordinates for any objects attached to the axis.

Movable axes also share the following additional parameters:

-  **Range:** Specifies the Minimum and Maximum travel extent of the
   axis with respect to the axis origin position. The range does not
   have to include the zero position.
-  **Slave axis to:** Specifies the name of another axis that will be
   used to control the current one. When the named axis moves, the
   current axis will also be moved. You can specify a Scaling factor to
   change the proportion of motion, and even the direction (by
   specifying a negative scale factor). An axis that is slaved will not
   appear in the QUEST lower right Axes window or the VM Controller Axes
   window in CERUN and GENER. Motion of a slaved axis is only possible
   by moving the parent axis (i.e., the one the axis is slaved to).
-  **Default position:** Specifies the position the axis will be set to
   when the model is loaded, or when the axis position is reset to its
   default.

When you add a new axis, it will appear in the lower right “Axes”
window. The axis name will also appear in the Model Navigator, attached
as a child (below) the object that was selected (in the Navigator) when
the axis was created. You can move the axis to a new position in the
Navigator by first selecting it with the mouse, then, while holding the
left-mouse button down, move to a new attachment point and release the
mouse button. Moving the axis name in the model navigator may change the
kinematics of the machine.

In addition to the parameters listed above, all axes share the common
parameters, listed below:

-  **Name:** Axis names are used in the Model Navigator in QUEST.
   Linear, Rotary and Curve axis names also appear in (and can be
   controlled from) the QUEST lower right Axes window as well as the VM
   Controller Axes window in CERUN and GENER VM assigns default names
   when objects are created. You should change the default to something
   that is both short and meaningful.
-  **Unit:** Specifies the unit of measure for all non-rotary values
   (angles are always specified in degrees).
-  **Position:** Specifies the X, Y and Z axis position of the origin of
   the current axis in relation to the origin and rotational alignment
   of the parent object. When world coordinates are selected
   (Simulation»Use World CS), the position of the axis is shown in world
   coordinates instead of relative to the parent object. When
   constructing an axis, the mouse pointer can be used to define the
   axis origin.
-  **OK** button: Creates the axis as defined.
-  **Cancel** button: Ignores this axis creation request.
-  **Apply** button: Updates the simulation window to show the effects
   of the latest changes.
-  **Rotate** button: Use this button to rotate the entity to its
   required final orientation. When an entity is rotated, anything
   attached below this entity in the Navigator will be defined in the
   new frame of rotation.

The Cylinder/Cone Property Dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image1| Defines a cylindrical or conical entity, given an XYZ origin
and the radius and height of the cylinder. Once created, the cylinder
can be further rotated to its required orientation. The starting and
ending radii can also be modified.

-  **Radius0:** The radius of the cylinder or cone at the initial
   position.
-  **Radius1:** The radius of the cylinder or cone at the “length”
   height.
-  **Length:** The height of the cylinder or cone in the Z axis (use the
   Rotate button to orient the cone as required).

Entities that represent curved shapes are approximated by faceted
surfaces. The following parameters are used for curved entities:

-  **Number of faces:** Specifies the number of facets to use to
   approximate a curved surface. The greater the number of facets, the
   smoother the surface will appear. Note that the trade-offs for smooth
   appearance are a longer rendering time and a higher CPU cost for
   collision detection.
-  **Use sharp edges:** Specifies how the object should be drawn. When
   sharp edges are used, a cylinder will appear with clearly defined
   facets (a cylinder with 4 facets and sharp edges looks identical to a
   cube entity). When smooth edges are used, the graphic engine will
   attempt to blend the edges, smoothing them out. You can get
   surprisingly smooth looking surfaces even with coarse faceting.

In addition to the parameters listed above, all entities share the
common parameters, listed below:

-  **Name:** Entity names are used in the Model Navigator in QUEST, and
   in collision diagnostic messages in CERUN and GENER. VM assigns
   default names when objects are created. You should change the default
   to something that is both short and meaningful.
-  **Unit:** Specifies the unit of measure for all non-rotary values
   (angles are always specified in degrees).
-  **Position:** Specifies the X, Y and Z axis position of the origin of
   the current object in relation to the origin and rotational alignment
   of the parent object. When world coordinates are selected
   (Simulation»Use World CS), the position of the entity is shown in
   world coordinates instead of relative to the parent object. When
   constructing an entity, the mouse pointer can be used to define the
   entity start position (and other parameters as well).
-  **Collision detection:** Select the Enable check box to activate
   collision testing against the current entity. Collision detection can
   be done using one of the following method:

   -  **Exact:** Collision is performed on the exact geometry of Entity
   -  **Offset:** An offset value is applied to the entity mesh and used
      as safety zone for collision
   -  **Entity:** Another entity is used as the the safety zone for this
      entity. Valid entities must be direct child without children of
      their own and they must not be part of any group. Valid entities
      are listed in the drop down box.
   -  **Use as safety entity for parent:** The entity is used as the
      safety zone for the parent. The parent property dialog will show
      collision using this entity as safety zone.

   Collision type is remembered even if the entity is disabled from
   collision. The collision type will be used if the entity gets
   re-enabled for collision dynamically by macro.
   You can see the extended collision envelope of all entities by
   toggling Simulation »Show»Safety zones from the menu bar.
-  **OK** button: Creates the entity as defined.
-  **Cancel** button: Ignores this entity creation request.
-  **Apply** button: Updates the simulation window to show the effects
   of the latest changes.
-  **Rotate** button: Use this button to rotate the entity to its
   required final orientation. When an entity is rotated, anything
   attached below this entity in the Navigator will be defined in the
   new frame of rotation.
-  **Material** button: Use this button to define the appearance (color)
   of the object. Material properties are described later under the
   topic “Materials Dialog". Objects are by default created using the
   material of the last object created or selected using the Materials
   Dialog (Ctrl Alt M shortcut).

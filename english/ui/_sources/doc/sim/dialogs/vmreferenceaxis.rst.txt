The Reference Axis Property Dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image1| Defines a reference axis, given an XYZ origin and possible
rotation (using the Rotate button). Reference axes do not cause motion.
Instead, reference axes can be used to organize the model in the Model
Navigator.

You can attach a group of related objects to a reference and then
collapse the group (in the model navigator), which might make the model
easier to understand. You can also use a reference to establish a new
coordinate frame for a group of related objects.

At run-time, VM groups together into “stiff bodies” objects that are
immovable in relation to each other. This optimization reduces the
number of calculations required when moving the components that are
attached to axes. Reference axes are preserved at run-time, so they can
be used in the model when it is necessary to manipulate a group of
components using the various $FMS macro functions.

A Reference Axis is defined using the following parameters:

-  **Name:** Axis names are used in the Model Navigator in QUEST.
   Linear, Rotary and Curve axis names also appear in (and can be
   controlled from) the QUEST lower right Axes window as well as the VM
   Controller Axes window in CERUN and GENER VM assigns default names
   when objects are created. You should change the default to something
   that is both short and meaningful.
-  **Unit:** Specifies the unit of measure for all non-rotary values
   (angles are always specified in degrees).
-  **Position:** Specifies the X, Y and Z axis position of the origin of
   the current axis in relation to the origin and rotational alignment
   of the parent object. When world coordinates are selected
   (Simulation»Use World CS), the position of the axis is shown in world
   coordinates instead of relative to the parent object. When
   constructing an axis, the mouse pointer can be used to define the
   axis origin.
-  **OK** button: Creates the axis as defined.
-  **Cancel** button: Ignores this axis creation request.
-  **Apply** button: Updates the simulation window to show the effects
   of the latest changes.
-  **Rotate** button: Use this button to rotate the entity to its
   required final orientation. When an entity is rotated, anything
   attached below this entity in the Navigator will be defined in the
   new frame of rotation.

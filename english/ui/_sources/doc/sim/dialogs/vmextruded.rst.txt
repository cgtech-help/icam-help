The Extruded Property Dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image1| Defines a swept 2D closed profile along a vector to produce an
extruded surface. Once created, the surface can be further rotated to
its required orientation using the Rotate button. See `Construct
Entity <../toolbars/vmtb_construct.html>`__ for a description of
parameters and controls not listed below.

-  **Length:** Specifies the distance to sweep the profile along the
   vector defined by the direction components.
-  **Direction:** Specifies the XYZ components of the vector to sweep
   the profile along.
-  **Profile button:** Select this button to enter the surface profile.
   The profile is defined as a series of (x, y) pairs of coordinates,
   one pair per line, which is extruded along a vector (positive Z by
   default) for the specified distance. The order in which points are
   defined is important; the outside surface of the profile is to the
   left of the curve defined by the points. The profile must be closed
   (i.e., it must start and end at the same point). You can specify one
   or more additional “island” contours to be subtracted from the main
   extruded shape by first specifying a semicolon “;” contour separator
   followed by the series of (x, y) pairs of coordinates of the island
   contour, one pair per line. Use the Apply button in the profile
   builder to see changes to the profile curve.

In addition to the parameters listed above, all entities share the
common parameters, listed below:

-  **Name:** Entity names are used in the Model Navigator in QUEST, and
   in collision diagnostic messages in CERUN and GENER. VM assigns
   default names when objects are created. You should change the default
   to something that is both short and meaningful.
-  **Unit:** Specifies the unit of measure for all non-rotary values
   (angles are always specified in degrees).
-  **Position:** Specifies the X, Y and Z axis position of the origin of
   the current object in relation to the origin and rotational alignment
   of the parent object. When world coordinates are selected
   (Simulation»Use World CS), the position of the entity is shown in
   world coordinates instead of relative to the parent object. When
   constructing an entity, the mouse pointer can be used to define the
   entity start position (and other parameters as well).
-  **Collision detection:** Select the Enable check box to activate
   collision testing against the current entity. Collision detection can
   be done using one of the following method:

   -  **Exact:** Collision is performed on the exact geometry of Entity
   -  **Offset:** An offset value is applied to the entity mesh and used
      as safety zone for collision
   -  **Entity:** Another entity is used as the the safety zone for this
      entity. Valid entities must be direct child without children of
      their own and they must not be part of any group. Valid entities
      are listed in the drop down box.
   -  **Use as safety entity for parent:** The entity is used as the
      safety zone for the parent. The parent property dialog will show
      collision using this entity as safety zone.

   Collision type is remembered even if the entity is disabled from
   collision. The collision type will be used if the entity gets
   re-enabled for collision dynamically by macro.
   You can see the extended collision envelope of all entities by
   toggling Simulation »Show»Safety zones from the menu bar.
-  **OK** button: Creates the entity as defined.
-  **Cancel** button: Ignores this entity creation request.
-  **Apply** button: Updates the simulation window to show the effects
   of the latest changes.
-  **Rotate** button: Use this button to rotate the entity to its
   required final orientation. When an entity is rotated, anything
   attached below this entity in the Navigator will be defined in the
   new frame of rotation.
-  **Material** button: Use this button to define the appearance (color)
   of the object. Material properties are described later under the
   topic “Materials Dialog". Objects are by default created using the
   material of the last object created or selected using the Materials
   Dialog (Ctrl Alt M shortcut).

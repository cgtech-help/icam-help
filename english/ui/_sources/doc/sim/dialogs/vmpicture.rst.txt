The Picture Property Dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image1| Defines a bitmap image, given the point in the model for the
lower left corner of the image, and the X-axis width and Y-axis height
of the image in model coordinates. The picture can be rotated to its
required orientation using the Rotate button.

-  **Width:** Specifies the length of the image measured along the
   X-axis.
-  **Height:** Specifies the length of the image measured along the
   Y-axis.
-  **Keep aspect ratio:** If checked, the image will retain its original
   shape, which may result in the length or height being smaller than
   intended. Clear this check box to stretch the image into the space
   defined.
-  **Load** button: Select this button to choose the bitmap image (.bmp)
   to load into the model.

Bitmap images must be compatible for OpenGL graphic texturing, and
therefore have some important restrictions. Also note that Textures can
place a heavy CPU burden on the rendering (image drawing) process, and
can take up a lot of space in the ICAM database.

-  Bitmaps must be constructed in 16-color or 256-color mode.
-  Bitmaps must not use RLE compression (i.e., they must be
   uncompressed).
-  The length and height of the image must be evenly divisible by a
   power of two.

In addition to the parameters listed above, all entities share the
common parameters, listed below:

-  **Name:** Entity names are used in the Model Navigator in QUEST, and
   in collision diagnostic messages in CERUN and GENER. VM assigns
   default names when objects are created. You should change the default
   to something that is both short and meaningful.
-  **Unit:** Specifies the unit of measure for all non-rotary values
   (angles are always specified in degrees).
-  **Position:** Specifies the X, Y and Z axis position of the origin of
   the current object in relation to the origin and rotational alignment
   of the parent object. When world coordinates are selected
   (Simulation»Use World CS), the position of the entity is shown in
   world coordinates instead of relative to the parent object. When
   constructing an entity, the mouse pointer can be used to define the
   entity start position (and other parameters as well).
-  **OK** button: Creates the entity as defined.
-  **Cancel** button: Ignores this entity creation request.
-  **Apply** button: Updates the simulation window to show the effects
   of the latest changes.
-  **Rotate** button: Use this button to rotate the entity to its
   required final orientation. When an entity is rotated, anything
   attached below this entity in the Navigator will be defined in the
   new frame of rotation.
-  **Material** button: Use this button to define the appearance (color)
   of the object. Material properties are described later under the
   topic “Materials Dialog". Objects are by default created using the
   material of the last object created or selected using the Materials
   Dialog (Ctrl Alt M shortcut).

**Note:** Collision testing is not performed on picture entities.

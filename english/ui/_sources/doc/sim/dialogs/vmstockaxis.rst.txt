The Stock Axis Property Dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image1| Defines a stock axis given an XYZ origin. Stock axes define the
table control point (TCP) of the machine. When stock, fixtures and parts
are loaded onto the machine (using CERUN or GENER), they are mounted
relative to a predefined stock axis.

-  **Part:** Specifies that this stock axis defines a table control
   point (TCP) of the machine. The ID should be set to 1 (one) for the
   most common mount point used on the machine. Other stock ID’s can be
   used if there are additional part mount points on the machine, for
   example, if there are multiple work areas. Use the CERUN and GENER
   Simulation»Stock, Simulation»Fixture and Simulation»Part menus to
   import or define stock, fixture and part objects relative to stock
   axes.
-  **Other:** Specifies a location where stock, fixtures and parts can
   be held. The current active part can be set using the $PART macro
   variable.
-  **Spindle activation:** Select the “This stock axis is turning when
   the following spindle is activated” check box if the stock axis
   represents a spindle. This is common for the turning spindle on lathe
   machines. You would normally not select this for an Other stock axis
   type. VM uses the Spindle ID to differentiate between the different
   spindles that might be available on a machine. For mill/turn
   machines, use the Axes mapping tab page of the machine properties
   dialog to identify the spindle as milling or turning. For lathes
   without a C controllable axis, the spindle ID should be 1 (one) for
   the main turning spindle of the machine. The choice of current active
   spindle can also be controlled using the $FMSMSP macro function.

You can define multiple stock axes if there are different places where
stock and fixtures might be loaded. For example, a tombstone with 4
faces might define 4 stock axes; each positioned and rotated (using the
Rotate button) to establish a part normal vector away from the surface.
If your model simulates pallet changing, you should define a stock axis
at the part reference point for each pallet.

Note that, for QUEST at least, the stock axis represents one end of the
kinematics chain. You cannot attach any other axis or entity to a stock
axis. CERUN and GENER on the other hand allow stock fixtures and parts
to be attached to a stock axis at run-time.

In addition to the parameters listed above, all axes share the common
parameters, listed below:

-  **Name:** Axis names are used in the Model Navigator in QUEST.
   Linear, Rotary and Curve axis names also appear in (and can be
   controlled from) the QUEST lower right Axes window as well as the VM
   Controller Axes window in CERUN and GENER VM assigns default names
   when objects are created. You should change the default to something
   that is both short and meaningful.
-  **Unit:** Specifies the unit of measure for all non-rotary values
   (angles are always specified in degrees).
-  **Position:** Specifies the X, Y and Z axis position of the origin of
   the current axis in relation to the origin and rotational alignment
   of the parent object. When world coordinates are selected
   (Simulation»Use World CS), the position of the axis is shown in world
   coordinates instead of relative to the parent object. When
   constructing an axis, the mouse pointer can be used to define the
   axis origin.
-  **OK** button: Creates the axis as defined.
-  **Cancel** button: Ignores this axis creation request.
-  **Apply** button: Updates the simulation window to show the effects
   of the latest changes.
-  **Rotate** button: Use this button to rotate the entity to its
   required final orientation. When an entity is rotated, anything
   attached below this entity in the Navigator will be defined in the
   new frame of rotation.

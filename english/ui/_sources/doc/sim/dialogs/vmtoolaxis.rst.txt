The Tool Axis Property Dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image1| Defines a tool axis, given an XYZ origin and tool reference
type. Tool axes can define the spindle control point of the machine,
pockets in a tool changer, or anywhere else that tools might be stored.

-  **Spindle:** Specifies that this tool axis defines the spindle
   control point (SCP) of the machine. The Tool axis ID should be set to
   1 (one) for the main spindle of the machine. Other tool ID’s can be
   used if there are additional controllable spindles on the machine.
   The tool axis ID to use for a given tool can be selected in the model
   Load Tool Event macro.
-  **Turret:** Specifies that this tool axis defines one of a series of
   available tool mount positions arrayed on a lathe turret. The Tool
   axis ID should be set to 1 (one) for the main turret of the machine.
   Set the ID to 2 for the side turret of the machine. The Pocket ID is
   used by VM to know which turret position is active based on the
   current tool selected. Pocket numbers must be unique for each turret.
-  **Pocket:** Specifies that this tool axis defines a pocket in the
   tool changer or some other holding area. A Pocket ID must be given to
   identify the pocket number. VM automatically moves tools in and out
   of pockets during tool change operations. Use the CERUN and GENER
   Simulation»Tools menu to assign tools to pockets.
-  **Other:** Specifies a location where tools can be held. A typical
   use for this type of tool axis is to define a position on a tool
   change mechanism where tools are held while in transit. Tools can be
   attached or detached from an “other” axis type using the $FMSATA
   macro function.
-  **Spindle activation:** Select the “This tool axis is turning when
   the following spindle is activated” check box if the tool axis
   represents a spindle. This is common for the spindle on milling
   machines, and for live tooling on mill/turn machines. You would
   normally not select this for a Pocket or Other tool axis type. VM
   uses the Spindle ID to differentiate between the different spindles
   that might be available on a machine. For mill/turn machines, use the
   Axes mapping tab page of the machine properties dialog to identify
   the spindle as milling or turning. For milling machines, the spindle
   ID should be 1 (one) for the main spindle of the machine. The choice
   of current active spindle can also be controlled using the $FMSMSP
   macro function.

Use the Rotate button to establish the orientation of the tool when it
is attached to the tool axis object.

Note that, for QUEST at least, the tool axis represents one end of the
kinematics chain. You cannot attach any other axis or entity to a tool
axis. CERUN and GENER on the other hand allow holders and tools to be
attached to a tool axis at run-time.

In addition to the parameters listed above, all axes share the common
parameters, listed below:

-  **Name:** Axis names are used in the Model Navigator in QUEST.
   Linear, Rotary and Curve axis names also appear in (and can be
   controlled from) the QUEST lower right Axes window as well as the VM
   Controller Axes window in CERUN and GENER VM assigns default names
   when objects are created. You should change the default to something
   that is both short and meaningful.
-  **Unit:** Specifies the unit of measure for all non-rotary values
   (angles are always specified in degrees).
-  **Position:** Specifies the X, Y and Z axis position of the origin of
   the current axis in relation to the origin and rotational alignment
   of the parent object. When world coordinates are selected
   (Simulation»Use World CS), the position of the axis is shown in world
   coordinates instead of relative to the parent object. When
   constructing an axis, the mouse pointer can be used to define the
   axis origin.
-  **OK** button: Creates the axis as defined.
-  **Cancel** button: Ignores this axis creation request.
-  **Apply** button: Updates the simulation window to show the effects
   of the latest changes.
-  **Rotate** button: Use this button to rotate the entity to its
   required final orientation. When an entity is rotated, anything
   attached below this entity in the Navigator will be defined in the
   new frame of rotation.

The Linear Axis Property Dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image1| Defines a linear axis, given an XYZ origin and the direction
vector and range of interpolation.

-  **Direction:** The direction of interpolation. Linear axes that move
   the tool typically have a standard positive direction, and those that
   move the part have a negative (reversed) direction, For example,
   moving the part in the negative X direction has the effect of moving
   the tool in the positive X direction with respect to the part. Select
   “Custom” if the linear axis does not interpolate along one of the
   major axes. When Custom is selected, you must enter a Custom
   direction, which defines the positive sense of interpolation given
   its X, Y and Z-axis vector components (the values do not have to be
   unitized).

When defining a linear axis with a Custom orientation, you can enter the
custom direction vector, or you can use a standard orientation and use
the Rotate button to orient the axis. Both methods produce identical
kinematics, but the Rotate method has the side effect of changing the
XYZ reference coordinates for any objects attached to the axis.

Movable axes also share the following additional parameters:

-  **Range:** Specifies the Minimum and Maximum travel extent of the
   axis with respect to the axis origin position. The range does not
   have to include the zero position.
-  **Slave axis to:** Specifies the name of another axis that will be
   used to control the current one. When the named axis moves, the
   current axis will also be moved. You can specify a Scaling factor to
   change the proportion of motion, and even the direction (by
   specifying a negative scale factor). An axis that is slaved will not
   appear in the QUEST lower right Axes window or the VM Controller Axes
   window in CERUN and GENER. Motion of a slaved axis is only possible
   by moving the parent axis (i.e., the one the axis is slaved to).
-  **Default position:** Specifies the position the axis will be set to
   when the model is loaded, or when the axis position is reset to its
   default.

When you add a new axis, it will appear in the lower right “Axes”
window. The axis name will also appear in the Model Navigator, attached
as a child (below) the object that was selected (in the Navigator) when
the axis was created. You can move the axis to a new position in the
Navigator by first selecting it with the mouse, then, while holding the
left-mouse button down, move to a new attachment point and release the
mouse button. Moving the axis name in the model navigator may change the
kinematics of the machine.

In addition to the parameters listed above, all axes share the common
parameters, listed below:

-  **Name:** Axis names are used in the Model Navigator in QUEST.
   Linear, Rotary and Curve axis names also appear in (and can be
   controlled from) the QUEST lower right Axes window as well as the VM
   Controller Axes window in CERUN and GENER VM assigns default names
   when objects are created. You should change the default to something
   that is both short and meaningful.
-  **Unit:** Specifies the unit of measure for all non-rotary values
   (angles are always specified in degrees).
-  **Position:** Specifies the X, Y and Z axis position of the origin of
   the current axis in relation to the origin and rotational alignment
   of the parent object. When world coordinates are selected
   (Simulation»Use World CS), the position of the axis is shown in world
   coordinates instead of relative to the parent object. When
   constructing an axis, the mouse pointer can be used to define the
   axis origin.
-  **OK** button: Creates the axis as defined.
-  **Cancel** button: Ignores this axis creation request.
-  **Apply** button: Updates the simulation window to show the effects
   of the latest changes.
-  **Rotate** button: Use this button to rotate the entity to its
   required final orientation. When an entity is rotated, anything
   attached below this entity in the Navigator will be defined in the
   new frame of rotation.

License Manager
***************

   An ICAM License Manager (ICAMLM) utility is available to check
   license availability and perform other license related tasks. The
   License Manager may be started either from the Start menu or from the
   ICAM Portal. In the descriptions that follow, keep in mind that with
   node-locked licenses, the server and client computer are the same,
   and that the license manager can be run from either perspective
   depending on where it is started.

-  To start the license manager utility from a **client** computer Start
   menu, first locate the “ICAM V26 x64” Start menu and then select
   “License Manager (CLIENT)”. To start the utility from the ICAM
   portal, select the Tools pane and click on the “ICAM License Manager
   (CLIENT)” tile or icon.

-  To start the license manager utility from the license **server**
   computer Start menu, first locate the “ICAM License Server V26 x64”
   Start menu and then select “License Manager (SERVER)”.

   You will see a window that looks similar to the one shown below.

The title bar of the license manager window lists the server
connection information.

Each line in the top half of the window lists a licensed product and
its options, the maximum number of licenses that are available and
the actual number that are in use including the hostname or IP
address of each computer that has the license checked out.

The bottom half of the window traces the activity of the license
server. From left to right this includes: the date and time of the
action; a 3-letter code describing the action; the client hostname or
IP address, or “icamlm” if it is a server related action; followed by
the action data (e.g., the license that was checked out). Select
Help»Legend for a description of the action codes. When the license
manager starts, it shows last 10 lines from the server log. This
initial count of lines can be changed from the Setup»Server
Connection menu.

The license manager functions available on the Setup menu depend on
whether the manager is being run from the client or from the server.

License Manager (CLIENT)
========================

The CLIENT version of the license manager is responsible for
establishing a connection to the ICAM license server. Server
connection information is contained in the *icam.key* file, which is
either stored in the ICAM application data directory (e.g.,
C:\\ProgramData\\ICAM\\240\\icam.key), or is kept elsewhere and
identified using an *icam_sec* environment variable.
   
To find the *icam.key* file, please run the ICAM Configuration utility
and look at the *Environment* tab.
   
-  **License commuting**: Starting with V26, you can commute licenses to use offline. Here are the rules and limitation of license commuting:
   *  Maximum of 7 days for a license commute.
   *  In order to commute a license, you must have a minimum of 2 available.
   *  The license must be version 260 or later.
   
To commute or return a commuted license, right-click on the license.

The following functions are available from
the Setup menu:

-  **Server Connection**: This dialog establishes a connection to an
   ICAM floating license server. You can drag and drop an icam.key file
   onto this dialog, or browse for the key file, to establish a
   connection to the server identified in the key file.

   You can setup the server connection manually, by entering the port
   number and name or IP address of the license server computer. A “Find
   LAN Servers” button will search for running ICAM license servers on
   the same LAN only (i.e., it cannot find a server that is one or more
   network hops away). For cloud servers, you must also enter the cloud
   security ID string that was given to you by the ICAM licensing
   department (keyfiles@icam.com), and your computer must have an
   Internet connection.

-  **Change** **Password**: A password can be setup to restrict access
   to changes to the client computer list from the license manager
   running on a client computer. From the client license manager, the current
   password need to be specified in order to change it.

-  **Manage Client List**: See the License Manager (SERVER) section
   below.

License Manager (SERVER)
========================

   The SERVER version of the license manager is responsible for setting
   up ICAM product licenses and configuring some ICAM license server
   options. ICAM product license information is contained in the
   *icamls.key* file in the ICAM server application data directory
   (e.g., C:\\ProgramData\\ICAM\\ Server\\icamls.key).

   The following functions are available from the Setup menu:

-  **Update Key File**: Use this funtion when a new *icamls.key* file is
   received from ICAM. You can drag and drop the new key file onto this
   dialog, or browse for the key file, or open the key file directory to
   facilitate copying the updated key file directly there.

-  **Server Port**: Set the primary port number to be used by the
   license server, which will become effective once all current licenses
   have been checked in, or following the next reboot or license server
   restart. Each client computer’s *icam.key* license server connec-
   tion file must be edited to specify the changed port number.

-  **Server Log Settings**: Defines the use, location and contents of a
   licensing activity log file. These changes become effective
   immediately.

-  **Change** **Password**: A password can be setup to restrict access
   to changes to the client computer list from the license manager
   running on a client computer. The current password is shown. If there
   is no password (the default) then the current password field will be
   empty. To create or change the password, enter the new password and
   repeat it, then press Ok. To remove the current password, simply
   press Ok without specifying a new password. Press Cancel to exit the
   dialog without changing the password.

-  **Manage Client List**: This dialog lists all client computers that
   have ever connected to the license server and checked out a license.
   The list of clients is maintained on a first come / first served
   basis. If all client spaces have been used, then new client computers
   cannot check out licenses. You can remove obsolete client computers
   from this list by selecting them and pressing the **Remove Client**
   button. When doing so from a client license manager, you must enter
   the password if one has been setup with the server license manager.
   Removing obsolete client computers from the list frees up space for
   new client computers.
   Note that once a client computer has been removed from the list, it
   is not eligible to check out licenses until the listed time limit has
   elapsed.

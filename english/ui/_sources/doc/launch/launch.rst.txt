Launch Panel
============

The launch panel provides a simple and interactive method of selecting
the appropriate set of postprocessing options. The launch panel
remembers the last settings used and saves this information in the
Windows Registry. Remembered settings can be recalled via the drop-down
lists that appear beside most launch panel input fields.

When GENER is started, the launch panel will appear as shown below.

When CERUN is started, the launch panel will appear as shown below.

Center tab selections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are separate tabs for GENER, CERUN, Virtual Machine and user
preferences. Availability of these tabs are controlled by licensing and
the **Processing** selection choice.

-  `GENER: specifies post-processing options <../launch/gener.html>`__
-  `CERUN: specifies control emulator options <../launch/cerun.html>`__
-  `VM: specifies simulation options <../launch/sim.html>`__
-  `Optimizer/Force: specifies Vericut Optimizer/Force integration options <../launch/vo.html>`__
-  `Preferences: specifies personal preferences <../launch/preferences.html>`__

Processing
~~~~~~~~~~

This setting defines the type of processing desired. Choices are as follows:

-  GENER Run the post-processor
-  CERUN Run the control emulator
-  PSE Run the post-processor and control emulator together
-  REVIEW Review results of a previously saved job

Select the GENER option to post-process a CL file to MCD code.

The CERUN and PSE selections are described in the Control Emulator User
Guide. In brief, CERUN starts execution of the ICAM Control Emulator.
PSE starts execution of GENER and CERUN together, along with a Virtual
Machine simulation.

The REVIEW selection is only available after selecting a zrj review file
using the JOB button or after dropping a zrj file on the launch panel.
This reviews the results of a previously run job.

Interface
~~~~~~~~~

GENER can run hidden as a background process or interactively as a
foreground process.

Select **Background** to run as a background process. When in background
mode, GENER will inhibit I/O operations to the console and will also
inhibit the display of dialog boxes. This will ensure uninterrupted
post-processing.

Select **Full** to run GENER with a interactive interface that can be
used to view and debug the actions of the post-processor. With Full
mode, GENER can show the interaction between input CL, output tape and
the macro processor using a variety of tracing and debugging features.
GENER starts in a paused state when running in Full mode; use the Run
menu or toolbar shortcuts to start post-processing.

Select Progress to run GENER with only a simple progress bar visible on
the desktop. When running with the progress bar, you can switch to the
full display by pressing the “More info” button. When post-processing
has completed, you can view the verification listing file by pressing
the “View Listing” button.

Select Minimize to run GENER in the background. When running in this
mode, no information is given about the execution progress. The less
information GENER is asked to present, the faster execution will be. At
any time you can restore the window to view the progress state, and from
there, switch to a full display.

When GENER is started in Back, Progress or Minimize modes, the Trace
windows will not be enabled unless “Save for review” is enabled. This is
done to speed up processing, since generating and recording trace
information consumes CPU and memory resources. To enable tracing from
the start of post-processing, run in Full mode and select Run»Fast (F8).

ICAM recommends that Background or Minimize mode be used when using
GENER in a production mode, since the CPU requirements are reduced.

Merged PSE Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This checkbox is available for PSE processing. If selected, GENER and
CERUN will run in parallel, with the MCD output of GENER being
immediately input and simulated by CERUN. PSE processing runs in series
if this checkbox is not selected. Once GENER reaches the end of
post-processing, CERUN will then simulate the generated MCD.

DEF file
~~~~~~~~

This field specifies the DEF file to use. By default, the definition
file is named ICAM.DEF and is stored in the application data directory
You can browse for a specific DEF file using the […] button.

OK, Cancel and other buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Press the **OK** button to start post-processing. GENER requires the CL
file name, the database and the post-processor name before it can
proceed. Everything else is optional.

Press **Cancel** to quit the launch panel without running GENER (changed
settings are not remembered in the Windows Registry when Cancel is
pressed).

Press `DB Manager (or AUTOPOST) button to perform database
management. <../launch/dbman.html>`__

Press `JOB button to save/recall launch panel
settings. <../launch/job.html>`__

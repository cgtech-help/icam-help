GENER Options
=============

The Options button on the main launch panel is only available for
selection once a CL file has been chosen. The following panel will
appear when the Options button is pressed:

Tape file
~~~~~~~~~

This field is automatically set to the default tape file name. You can
change the name for a single execution of the post-processor, but the
settings will not be remembered the next time GENER is launched. The
default tape file extension can be changed to a different value using
the *file_ext_tape* DEF file setting. The default directory path can be
changed to a different value using the *icam_tap* environment variable.

Listing file
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When checked, this field is automatically set to the default listing
file name. When cleared, a log file will be created instead. You can
change the name for a single execution of the postprocessor, but the
settings will not be remembered the next time GENER is launched. The
default listing file extension can be changed to a different value using
the *file_ext_nclist* or *html_ext_list* DEF file settings depending on
whether normal or HTML output is selected. The default directory path
can be changed to a different value using the *icam_lst* environment
variable.

Plot file
~~~~~~~~~

This field is automatically set to the default back-plot file name. You
can change the name for a single execution of the post-processor, but
the settings will not be remembered the next time GENER is launched. The
default back-plot file extension can be changed to a different value
using the *file_ext_plot* DEF file setting. The default directory path
can be changed to a different value using the *icam_lst* environment
variable.

Log file
~~~~~~~~

When checked, this field will be automatically set to the default log
file name. When cleared, a listing file will be created instead. You can
change the name for a single execution of the post-processor, but the
settings will not be remembered the next time GENER is launched. The
default log file extension can be changed to a different value using the
*file_ext_log* DEF file setting. The default directory path can be
changed to a different value using the *icam_lst* environment variable.

Trace in Listing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enables the tracing of various types of data in the listing file.

-  **CL Records**: If selected, CL file records will be shown in the
   listing file as they are read.
-  **Error messages**: If selected, diagnostic messages will include a
   trace-back showing the macro command (if any) that was being executed
   when the diagnostic occurred.
-  **Regular macros**: If selected, macro commands originating from the
   post-processor will be shown in the listing file as they are
   processed.
-  **Before and after macros**: If selected, macro commands originating
   from CAM interface kits will be shown in the listing file as they are
   processed.

Also include information aboutâ€¦
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enables the display and tracing of additional types of data.

-  **Original input source lines**: If selected, CL file records will be
   shown in the listing file and the verbose display in their original
   input format whenever possible. By default, GENER displays and traces
   CL file data in an ICAM standard format. This setting only has an
   effect when a record is first read. Records that are re-read
   following a look-ahead or CL file repositioning, will always be shown
   in their standard format.
-  **Look ahead processing, curve fitting and $FGET search**: If
   selected, tracing will also be enabled during all forms of
   look-ahead. Select this only when debugging macros that use the
   look-ahead features of GENER.

OK, Cancel and Reset buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Press **OK** to accept any changes to the Options panel and return to
the main launch panel. Press **Cancel** to ignore your changes and
return to the main launch panel. Press **Reset** to remove all
specialized settings and reset the file names and trace options to their
defaults.

CERUN Options
=============

The Options button on the main launch panel is only available for
selection once a MCD file has been chosen. The following panel will
appear when the Options button is pressed:

**Listing file**

When checked (the default), a listing file will be created containing
identification information about the NC program being emulated and the
control emulator and model used in the simulation, as well as diagnostic
and tracing information, followed finally by a program summary. The
default listing file has the same name as the MCD file with a file type
of *lce*. You can change the listing file name for a single execution of
the control emulator, but the settings will not be remembered the next
time CERUN is launched.

**Log file**

When checked, this field will be automatically set to the default log
file name. When cleared, a listing file will be created instead. You can
change the name for a single execution of the CERUN, but the settings
will not be remembered the next time CERUN is launched. The default log
file extension can be changed to a different value using the
*file_ext_log* DEF file setting. The default directory path can be
changed to a different value using the *icam_lce* environment variable.

**Trace in listing**

Enables the tracing of various types of data to the listing file.
Tracing is not output to the log file.

-  **Input blocks (MCD)**: If selected, machine control data (i.e.,
   tape) blocks will be shown in the listing file in the form “Block:
   *mcd*\ ”. This disables the default “\ *blocknumber*! *mcd*\ ”
   tracing of MCD in the listing file.
-  **Edited blocks**: If selected, the resultant MCD after edits by
   various initial processes are shown, in the form
   “\ *process*: *edited-mcd*\ ”, where *process* is one of:

   -  TapEdt: for changes done by the Tape Editor
   -  PrePrc: for changes done by the Pre-Processor
   -  BlkMac: for changes done by the Block Macro
   -  EmbMac: for changes done by the Embedded Macro Processor
   -  DelOn: for changes done due to OPSKIP (i.e., block delete) being
      active
   -  DelOff: for changes done due to OPSKIP being inactive

-  **Word addresses**: If selected, the individual word addresses (i.e.,
   registers) on the MCD block will be listed, one per line, in the form
   “\ *register*: *value*\ ”.
-  **CODE and DATA identifiers**: If selected, the individual CODE and
   DATA identifiers will be listed, one per line, in the form
   “code\_\ *name*\ ” and “reg\_\ *name*\ ”, as they are processed.
-  **Actions**: If selected, the final actions taken by the control
   emulator will be listed, one per line, in the form
   “| *description*\ ”.
-  **Code and Data macros**: If selected, macro commands originating
   from the control emulator CODE and DATA macros will be shown in the
   listing file as they are processed.
-  **Other macros**: If selected, macro commands originating from all
   other macros (i.e., Startup, Shutdown, Event and Function) will be
   shown in the listing file as they are processed.
-  **Operator and other messages**: If selected, operator messages will
   be echoed to the listing file.
-  **MDI and EXEC commands**: If selected, MDI (manual data input) and
   macro EXEC commands will be traced to the listing, in the form
   “mdi! *mcd*\ ” or “exec: *command-parameters*\ ”.
-  **Internal //icamfs subprograms**: If selected, subprograms that are
   run from the internal //icamfs storage area will be traced to the
   listing. If internal subprograms are not traced, then all other
   tracing is inhibited while processing internal subprograms, with the
   exception of Actions.

**OK, Cancel and Reset buttons**

Press **OK** to accept any changes to the Options panel and return to
the main launch panel. Press **Cancel** to ignore your changes and
return to the main launch panel. Press **Reset** to remove all
specialized settings and reset the file names and trace options to their
defaults.

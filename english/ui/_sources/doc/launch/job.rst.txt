JOB Button
==========

The JOB button can be used to save or recall launch panel settings into
a “job” file (cpj file extension) or to select the saved results (zrj
file extension) from a program that has been previously run with “save
for review” enabled.

Job Files
~~~~~~~~~

Job files (*cpj* file extension) are ideal if you regularly use launch
panel settings that are different from the suggested default, or if you
have specific settings for a special job that you intend to run on a
regular basis. Manufacturing Extractors use job files to hold all of the
information that is extracted from the CAM system for a specific NC
program, using a job file name that matches the NC program name.

When the JOB button is pressed, you will be given a choice to load
settings from a job file or to save the current settings to a job file.
The five most recently used job files are listed for quick loading.

You can also load the settings from a job file by dragging and dropping
the cpj file onto the launch panel window.

Review Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The JOB button can also be used to select the saved results (zrj file
extension) from a program that has been previously run with “save for
review” enabled.

When the JOB button is pressed and a review file selected, the
processing type will be set to REVIEW and the interface will
automatically be set to Full. Press OK to start GENER to view the
results of the completed program.

You can also start the review of a previously completed program by
dragging and dropping the zrj file onto the launch panel window.

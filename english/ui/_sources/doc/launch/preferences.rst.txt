Preferences Settings
====================

The Preferences tab provides settings that affect how the launch panel
and software behaves. These personal preference settings do not affect
how MCD is generated.

Enable launch panel tooltip help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enables the display of tooltip help messages when the cursor is placed
over an input field in the launch panel.

Use common browse directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If selected, all launch panel […] browse functions will start from the
last directory browsed. When cleared, each launch panel […] browse
button will remember and start from the last directory browsed for its
own specific file type.

Detect new/updated files on launch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If selected, the launch panel will notify you when *dmp* or *dp* files
(exported or dedicated postprocessors, control emulators and models) are
added to or changed in the last directory used to Import such files into
the database . The launch panel checks for dmp and dp files more recent
than the date of the last import.

Save for review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If selected, GENER and CERUN will save their results at the end of
processing into a file having the same name as the listing, but with a
file type of *zrj*. To review an NC program’s results, drag and drop the
zrj file onto the launch panel or desktop icon (or open the results
using the JOB button), then press OK.

Virtual Machine Settings
========================

The VM tab is used to associate a Virtual Machine model with the
selected post-processor and/or to perform material removal simulation on
the stock model.

Integrated post-processing with machine model simulation is a feature of
the Virtual Machine product from ICAM, available as a separately
licensed vmr product. Integrated post-processing with material removal
simulation is available as a separately licensed xmr product. The VM tab
will only be available if at least one of these licenses are present.

**Enable Material Removal Simulation**

Select this checkbox to enable the simulation of the material removal
process with respect to the stock model. Material removal simulation
(MRS) shows the effect of the cutting action of the tool on the stock
model. MRS also improves the collision detection process when used with
a model (see below), using the in-process stock for collision testing.
If this checkbox is not checked, it will not be possible to start MRS
once the program has started.

MRS is an add-on licensed option to VM. This checkbox will only be
available for selection if you have an xmr product license.

**Enable Virtual Machine Simulation**

Select this checkbox to enable the simulation of the CNC machine using a
Virtual Machine model. Machine simulation shows the effect at the CNC
machine as the MCD is read and also provides axes over-travel checking
and collision detection. If this box is not checked, it will not be
possible to start machine simulation once the program has started.

This checkbox will only be available for selection if you have a vmr
product license.

**Database**

This input field is used to select the database that contains the model
to use. You can browse for a database using the square browse button […]
located immediately to the right of the text window, or you can drag and
drop a database (dbf, dmp or dp) file onto the launch panel Simulation
tab. The last four database selections are remembered. They can be
re-accessed by selecting them from the drop-down list. The browse
database panel remembers the last directory browsed for a database,
unless the *icam_dbf* environment variable is set.

**Model and Revision (Rev)**

Use these input fields to choose a model from the selected database. The
model drop-down presents a list of all models in the selected database.
The revision field lists the latest revision of the selected model and
the drop-down lists other revisions, if any. Information about the
selected model will appear below the input field.

One of the available model choices is “Use associated”, which when
selected will use the model associated with the selected post-processor.
You cannot choose a specific revision of a model that is selected by
association.

GENER cannot run a model created with a version of QUEST that is higher
than the GENER version.

**Verification setup file**

This file contains part program specific setup information such as
tooling, part, stock, fixture, compensation, lighting adjustments and a
variety of other settings unique to each NC program. This field is
automatically set to the same name as the MCD file, with a file
extension of “.vsw”. You can change the name for a single execution of
the post-processor; either by typing a file name, using the […] browse
button or dragging a dropping a vsw file into the launch panel
Simulation tab, but the settings will not be remembered the next time
GENER is launched.

A verification setup file that has been created with GENER during post
processing can later be reused by CERUN during MCD verification and vice
versa.

**Vericut project file**

In the launcher, the user can select a vcproject file as a verification setup file.
Then, i will convert to Icam's verification file and it will be loaded.

.. Note::

   there are some limitation on the conversion, such as sile format for parts,
   and also the tool type, which currently probe and milling is supported. 
   In the launcher, the user can select a vcproject file as a verification setup file.
   Then, it will be converted to Icam's verification file and loaded.

**PP to use Vericut verification project file (.Vcproject) to provide fixture and tool length compensation when not using VM**

Gener uses fixture and tool length compensation only when a virtual machine (VM) is running. However, the new updates allow customers who have 
Vericut and Icam software to use the Vericut project file in the VM tab. Then, the Gener will run in a special case that first converts 
the Vericut verification file to an Icam verification file (.vsw) and then uses this data for compensation values.

.. Note::

   that the Postprocessor should have the logic to utilize the compensation values and use this data accordingly.

About QUEST and CERUN
=====================

Control Emulator consists of two parts: QUEST and CERUN.

-  **QUEST** is an interactive program used to build control emulator
   files that are stored within a database. Each file contains
   information entered about a specific numerically controlled (NC)
   machine and control.

   \

-  **CERUN** is an interactive program that uses this database to
   determine how to process the MCD for a specific CNC machine. CERUN
   takes as input MCD that is typically generated by a NC post-processor
   (such as ICAM’s Icam Post product), but that could also be created by
   hand or in other ways. CERUN outputs a verification listing file
   identifying syntax problems in the MCD, but its main benefit is in
   simulating the CNC manufacturing process. CERUN uses the following
   components to do that.

CERUN is generally run in combination with one or more of the following,
to enable visualization of the emulated MCD program on the CNC machine:

-  **VIRTUAL MACHINE** (VM) is an ICAM licensed product that simulates
   the motions of a CNC machine. VM models are created with QUEST and
   are used by CERUN (and Icam Post GENER) to test the NC program for
   correctness as described in the “core objectives” paragraph above.

   \

-  **Material Removal Simulation** (MRS) is an ICAM licensed option that
   is used to simulate the material removal process between the cutting
   tools and the raw material stock. MRS simulation can test for
   collisions between stock and tools as well as stock and any other
   collision enabled component of the model.

   \

-  **DELMIA** is a Dassault Systèmes product that simulates the motions
   of a CNC machine from within the CATIA or 3DEXPERIENCE CAM system.
   CERUN can interface directly with DELMIA to test the NC program for
   correctness and to perform material removal simulation.

About Control Emulator
======================

Control Emulator CERUN is a computer numerical control (CNC) machine
emulator, used by the computer aided manufacturing (CAM) system
numerical control (NC) programmer to verify the correctness of
machine control data (MCD), also known as NC programs or G-Code,
before running the MCD on the actual CNC machine. Control Emulator is
a software application that simulates the behavior of the CNC
machine, by processing the MCD in the same way that the actual CNC
machine does.

The core objective of Control Emulator is to determine the
correctness of the MCD, primarily as it relates to the movement of
machine axes, with the goal being to predict if running the MCD will
cause damage to the machine, workpiece or tooling. It does this by
simulating the MCD in a virtual environment, testing for collisions
between the machine components (e.g., tooling, table, head) and the
part being manufactured (e.g., fixtures, clamps, workpiece). It also
performs other validation, such as axis limit checking.

Control Emulator includes a powerful, yet easy to use macro language
that allows you to completely customize your control emulators to
support unusual CNC control and machine tool features.

Types of Machines Supported
---------------------------

.. index:: Machine; types supported

Control Emulator provides built-in support of the following CNC
machine axis types:

-  Primary linear axes ( X Y Z )

-  Secondary co-linear axes ( U V W )

-  Head rotary axes to orient the tool ( A B C )

-  Table rotary axes to orient the workpiece ( A' B' C' )

-  Any Extending axis or quill ( E )

-  Any exchangeable head including nutating ( N N' )

Control Emulator supports the following machine types:

-  Milling machines and machining centers (5 axes and up â€” all
   combinations of linear and rotary axes)

-  Lathes (2 and 4 axes) and merging lathes (4 axes), with optional
   sub-spindle

-  Mill-Turn centers (XZC), with additional Y axis, rotary heads and/or
   tables, merging turrets, and optional sub-spindle

-  Lasers, flame cutters and profilers

-  Robots (6 revolute axes)

-  Composite or Hybrid machining centers, which can combine the
   capabilities of multiple machining technologies and are supported by
   combining the capabilities of multiple control emulators.

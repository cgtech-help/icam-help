The ICAM Control Emulator is software that emulates or simulates the
operations of a CNC (computer numerically controlled) machine. It
does this by reading and processing MCD (machine control data, also
commonly called tape) in the same manner as the CNC would and by
manipulating a virtual model of the CNC machine, for one or more of
the following purposes:

-  To test the machine axes movements for over-travel conditions.

-  To test for collisions between tools, fixtures, parts, stock and machine components.

-  To test the effect of workpiece, length and diameter compensation.

-  To validate the MCD program for syntax errors.

-  To verify the correctness of the resulting as-machined stock.

Control Emulator consists of two parts: QUEST and CERUN.

-  **QUEST** is an interactive program that builds a database containing
   information entered about one or more CNC (computer numerically
   controlled) machines.

   \

-  **CERUN** uses this database, along with the MCD files generated by a
   post-processor, human or other system, to emulate the actions and
   processing of a particular CNC machine.

This manual describes the complete Control Emulator product, organized as
follows.

-  :ref:`“Control Emulator: Getting Started”<intro_section>`
   describes the steps necessary to install, upgrade,
   and configure your system to run this latest release of Control Emulator.

   \

-  :ref:`“QUEST: Control Emulator Development”<quest_section>`
   describes the use of the control emulator
   development tool QUEST. This section is only of interest to those
   sites licensed for full development and those persons responsible for
   control emulator creation at a site. It includes instructions on how
   to run QUEST, details of the QUEST system, macro programming
   references and other information useful to developers.

   \

-  :ref:`“CERUN: Control Emulator Run-Time”<cerun_section>`
   describes the use of the control emulator
   itself, named CERUN. This includes instructions on how
   to use CERUN with Virtual Machine and Dassault Systèmes 3DX/DELMIA.

Following these sections are:
a :ref:`“Glossary”<glossary>` of terms used in this manual;
an :ref:`“Appendix”<appendix>` listing information of possible interest to both users and developers alike; and
an :ref:`“Index”<genindex>`.

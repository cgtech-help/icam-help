Reserved Words
**************

Reserved words are keywords that are used by the ICAM macro language.
Words marked with \*\* are reserved for use by the Icam Post product.

   .. Developer's note:
      Sphinx does not support text that flows from the bottom of one column to the
      top of the next in a multi-column table. If a word is added or removed from
      the list of reserved words, then the table must be manually reorganized. The
      reserved words are maintained in a 4 column product-specific csv file in the
      hope that this makes it easier to modify the table.

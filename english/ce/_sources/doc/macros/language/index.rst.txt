The Macro Language
==================

The ICAM macro language is used for the customization of
control emulators, as well as for the customization of Icam Post
post-processors and Virtual Machine models. When a control emulator is
running in tandem with a Virtual Machine model, the control emulator
macro environment is shared with the model macro environment. Care
must be taken to avoid conflicts in variable usage between macros of
these different components. CERUN does not run within the same
environment as GENER, so conflicts between control emulator and
post-processor macros are not an issue.

Macros allow the control emulator to manipulate the blocks of the
input MCD to alter how they are processed. Macros can construct new
MCD blocks for processing, or suppress or modify individual codes and
data registers on a block. Macro features also exist to reposition
the input MCD file block pointer and to read and write to external
files (and much more).

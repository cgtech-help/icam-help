CERUN with DELMIA
*****************

ICAM’s control emulator run-time **CERUN** is integrated within the
Dassault Systèmes CATIA V5 and 3DEXPERIENCE DELMIA machine simulation
products. CERUN drives the DELMIA model during MCD simulation.

CERUN (and Icam Post, if also post-processing) must be installed on
the computer or network drive before using them in a production
environment (see :ref:`“Installation and Upgrade”<installation>`).
The Dassault Systèmes software installation includes a demonstration copy of
Icam Post and CERUN, but these are not suitable for production use due to
limitations in the demonstration versions.

-  :ref:`“Setup CERUN”<setup_ce>` describes the ICAM setup requirements to
   ensure that CATIA V5 and 3DEXPERIENCE run with the latest installed version of
   CERUN.

   \

-  :ref:`“MCD Based Simulation with CATIA V5”<mcdsimcatv5>` describes how to
   integrate CERUN into CATIA V5, and how to prepare, post-process, and MCD simulate
   a manufacturing process.

   \

-  :ref:`“MCD Based Simulation with 3DEXPERIENCE”<mcdsim3d>` does the same as above, for 3DEXPERIENCE.

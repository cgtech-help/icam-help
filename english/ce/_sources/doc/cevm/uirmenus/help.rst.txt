   Saves the current CERUN state and all associated files into
   a compressed archive file, with file extension *zpj*, suitable for
   e-mailing to ICAM Technical Support. This can be done at any time during
   control emulation. The zpj file will include the control emulator and model,
   interface kit, input MCD file(s), simulation data, and all
   listing and log files generated to that point.
   A *job_info.html* is also included in the archive listing system information,
   ICAM environment variables, ICAM licensing and CERUN command line options.

**Help»Customer ID…**

   This menu selection lists your customer ID, also called a PRISER
   (primary serial number). This unique identification is required when
   making technical support requests.

| **Help»Check for Update…**
| **Help»Update Available…**

   The **Check for Update** menu selection contacts an ICAM server on
   the Internet to determine if there is a more recent release of the
   software available for download. If so, a [Download…] button will be
   available. Updates come in two forms: official updates periodically
   made available to all customers, and hotfix updates made available to
   specific customers to solve a reported problem.

   Selecting the download button will download an installation
   executable file with the name
   icam\_\ *version*-*modlev*\ \_win\ *nn*.exe. To install the update,
   follow the :ref:`“Installing from download link”<install_download>` instructions.

   Updates are automatically checked once per day unless disabled by
   clearing the “Check for update” box on the dialog. If updates are
   available, the menu selection changes to **Update Available**.

**Help»About**

   This menu selection lists the version and mod-level (modification
   level). This information is also available at the top of the CERUN
   listing. It is generally helpful to include the version and mod-level
   in any technical support request.

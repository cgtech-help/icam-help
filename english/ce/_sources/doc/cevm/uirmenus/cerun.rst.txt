CERUN Menu
~~~~~~~~~~

The Control Emulator specific menu options are described below.

**CERUN»Code Groups**

   The Controller window contains a Code Groups tab that can be used to
   view and optionally modify the currently active code for each of the
   code groups defined by the control emulator. See
   :ref:`“Simulation»Controller: Code Groups”<sim_controller_code_groups>`.

**CERUN»MDI**

   The Controller window contains an MDI (manual data input) tab that
   can be used to execute one or more blocks of MCD at the start of the
   program, or during program verification when the program is paused.
   See :ref:`“Simulation»Controller: MDI”<sim_controller_mdi>`.

**CERUN»Opskip**

   The Controller window also contains an Opskip (optional-skip, also
   known as “block-delete”) tab that can be used to change the opskip
   settings during processing. See
   :ref:`“Simulation»Controller: Opskip”<sim_controller_opskip>`.

**CERUN»Option**

   Use this menu selection to activate the CERUN options dialog, which
   is used to set the actions of the Control Emulator when various
   special codes are encountered in the program. These codes are
   identified by their post-processor command name, if defined in the
   control emulator, as follows:

   :STOP: Code used to halt processing (e.g., M0)
   :OPSTOP: Code used to optionally halt processing (e.g., M1) REWIND Code used to restart processing (e.g., M30)
   :END: Code used to end processing (e.g., M2)

   You can set the action for each code as follows:

   -  **Pause** will stop CERUN processing when the code is encountered.
      You must then select one of the Run menu selections to continue or
      restart processing.
   -  **Halt** will end CERUN processing. Once halted, you can either exit
      or restart processing from the beginning of the program.
   -  **Ignore** simply ignores the code, which can be useful to continue
      processing past an END or REWIND code.

   These settings are remembered in the Windows Registry.

Run Menu
~~~~~~~~

**Run»Restart** (Shift F5)

   Stops control emulation and rewinds the MCD
   file to the start. Debugging breakpoints are remembered if the
   “Remember breakpoints between sessions” checkbox is selected in
   the Breakpoint Manager. Changes made to Execute and Trace states
   of macros in the Macro Manager are not remembered.

**Run»Play** (F5)

   Continues processing after it has been paused.

**Run»Pause** (F6)

   Pauses processing.

**Run»Step** (F7)

   Pauses processing after the next line of trace output is written
   to the trace window that currently has focus. Clicking with the
   left-mouse button in a trace window is a shortcut for the Step
   feature.

**Run»Fast** (F8)

   Continues processing after it has been paused, hiding the full
   display window and showing instead the smaller progress window. The
   progress window requires much less CPU to update than the full
   display window. Use the Fast-forward function to more quickly advance
   through the
   MCD
   file from one point of interest to another.
   Break-point checking remains enabled when the progress window is
   active. The “More Details” button on the progress window can be
   pressed to restore the full display window.

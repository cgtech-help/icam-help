The amount and types of information traced to the Input, Output,
Console and Macro windows can be set using the
Tools»Preferences»Trace menu function as well as from the launch
panel Output dialog (see :ref:`here<options_dialog>`).

**View»Input**

   This toggle activates or disables the input
   MCD file trace window. When active, MCD blocks
   will be listed in the Input window as they are read.
   Right-mouse in the Input window and select Options to bring up the
   following Tools»Preferences»Trace settings that affect Input tracing:

   -  **MDI and EXEC commands:** traces blocks of MCD as they are processed
      via the MDI input. It also traces the content of macro EXEC commands.
   -  **External subprograms:** traces blocks of MCD read from subprograms.
   -  **Internal ICAMFS subprograms:** also traces blocks of MCD read from
      subprograms stored in the internal //icamfs file storage area.

The last 20,000 input trace lines are remembered unless changed via
the Tools»Preferences»Trace settings. The Output, Console and Macro
trace windows (described below) are similarly limited.

**View»Output**

   This toggle activates or disables the
   control emulator processing trace window.
   When active, control emulator processing data will be listed in the
   Output window as it is written.
   Right-mouse in the Output window and select Options to bring up the
   following Tools»Preferences»Trace settings that affect Output tracing:

   -  **Input blocks:** traces input MCD blocks with a “Block:” prefix
      aligned so that you can better see the effect of any Edited blocks
      tracing (see next).
   -  **Edited blocks:** traces changes to the input block due to tape
      editor string substitution (identified by a TapEdt header), OPSKIP
      processing (DelOn and DelOff headers), pre- processor substitution
      (PrePrc header), embedded macro substitution (EmbMac header) and
      block startup macro processing (BlkMac header).
   -  **Word addresses:** traces the recognized words (i.e., registers) on
      the block and their values, one per line in the order they are
      recognized left-to-right on the block, using the format
      “\ *register*:*data*\ ”.
   -  **CODE and DATA identifiers:** traces the recognized CODE and DATA
      identifiers as they are processed, in the form code\_\ *name* and
      reg\_\ *name*. The order of code processing is dependent on the
      code’s Order property and not the position of the code the block. The
      order of data processing is a built-in function.
   -  **Actions:** traces lines prefixed with a \| character showing the
      data sent to the machine simulation process to emulate the actions of
      the CNC.

**View»Console**

   This toggle activates or disables the console trace window.
   When active, operator messages, diagnostic messages and macro processor
   I/O will be listed in the Console window.
   Right-mouse in the Console window and select Options to bring up the
   following Tools»Preferences»Trace settings that affect Console tracing:

   -  **Operator and other** **message:** traces operator
      messages.
   -  **Macro IO commands:** traces macro processor file I/O (OPEN, READ,
      WRITE and CLOSE commands).
   -  **Diagnostics:** traces diagnostic messages with the specified and
      higher severity.

**View»Macro**

   This toggle activates or disables the Macro trace window. When active,
   macro commands will be listed in the Macro window as they are processed.
   The Macro trace window also identifies when macros are activated and completed.
   Right-mouse in the Macro window and select Options to bring up the
   following Tools»Preferences»Trace settings that affect Macro tracing:

   -  **CODE and DATA macros:** traces lines of macro code from CODE and
      DATA macros as they are processed.
   -  **Other macros:** traces lines of macro code from startup, shutdown
      and event macros as they are processed.

**View»Diagnostic**

   This toggle shows or hides the Diagnostic window. This window records
   all diagnostic messages output since the start of processing,
   regardless of whether or not the window was visible or not.

   The diagnostic window provides “filter” toggle buttons that can be
   used to hide/show errors, warnings and informational messages. A
   right-mouse pop-up window provides access to additional
   functionality, as follows:

   -  **Synchronize** simulation, trace and source windows to the selected
      diagnostic.
   -  **Mark as reviewed** marks individual diagnostics as reviewed, as an
      aid to a systematic review of the program. Various options permit
      marking of similar diagnostics. Diagnostics can also be marked
      reviewed by selecting them and checking the Reviewed box.
   -  **Hide reviewed** toggle shows or hides all diagnostics marked as
      reviewed.
   -  **Clear reviewed** clears the “reviewed” state of all diagnostics.
      The reviewed state of diagnostics can also be cleared by selecting
      them and clearing the Reviewed box.
   -  **Clear sorting** causes diagnostics to be listed in the order they
      were originally output. Clicking on a diagnostic column header causes
      diagnostics to be sorted in increasing or decreasing order by that
      column’s information.
   -  **Column** settings indicate the type of information to be listed.
   -  **Copy selection** to the paste buffer.

   Diagnostic window settings are remembered with other user preferences
   in the Windows Registry.

**View»Loading Sequence**

   This brings back the Loading dialog that normally appears while the
   software is initializing and that then disappears once processing is
   ready to start. This dialog lists the various initialization actions
   and the elapsed time taken for each. Indentation is used to break
   down multiple steps of an initialization process. The Loading dialog
   must be closed before continuing processing. The appearance of the
   Loading dialog at the start of processing can be controlled from the
   “\ **Loading/ Processing Detail**\ ” selection in the
   Tools»Preferences»General settings.

| **View»Increase X Margin** (Ctrl Left)
| **View»Decrease X Margin** (Ctrl Right)

   These change the width of the left hand field that lists axes names
   in the Controller»Axes tab.

**View»Status bar**

   This toggle enables the display of the status bar. The status bar
   lists various information about the progress of the control emulator,
   including: count of diagnostics,
   sequence and tool numbers, machining time
   and a progress bar.

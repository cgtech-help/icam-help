Simulation»Tools/Holders/Heads (Ctrl Alt T)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This menu bar selection provides the ability to add tools and their
associated tool-holder definitions to the simulation, as well as to
select the active head on a machine that supports multiple exchangeable
head attachments.

Tool and holder definitions are automatically saved in the verification
setup (.vsw) file when the program is completed. This setup file will be
reused on subsequent runs to quickly reestablish the tooling necessary
for an accurate simulation. Tool and holder definitions from another
part program can be imported into the current session by pressing the
**Import** button and then selecting the verification setup (.vsw) file
of the other part program.

Tooling definitions, like fixture and part definitions, are not a
required element for simulation, but if used they add to simulation
accuracy and realism. VM attaches solid model representations of holders
and tools to the spindle control point (SCP). Once attached, they become
a part of the collision detection process.

Details about tool and holder definitions can be found in the
“Virtual Machine V26 Users Guide”.

Heads are defined in the model and the sole purpose of this
dialog is to select the active head (:ref:`see “Heads” <sim_head>`) below. The
**middle** section of the tool/holder dialog contains the various
controls that allow for the creation and modification of tools and
holders. The **right** side of the tool/holder dialog has two viewing
panes that are dynamically updated to reflect modifications done in the
center section.

-  The **upper right pane** is the construction view. Depending on the
   type of tool or holder, this can either be in a 2D or 3D view format.
   For the 2D format, hold the left-mouse button down to pan the view,
   hold and release the right-mouse button to zoom to a selected region,
   and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Double-click in the view
   to reset the zoom factor to make the tool or holder fully visible.
   The standard VM controls apply for navigating a 3D view.

   \

-  The **lower right pane** is a 3D assembly pre-view centered on the
   tool or holder. The standard VM controls apply for navigating a 3D
   view. Holding and then releasing the right-mouse button while moving
   horizontally will impart a spin on the object; click once in the
   window to remove the spin. The button controls at the upper left edge
   orient the tool in various planes, fit the tool in the window, and
   show the effect of spindle rotation on the tool. The right-mouse
   pop-up context menu provides additional functions to aid in viewing
   the tool or holder.

When exiting the Tools/Holders/Heads dialog, VM will
validate the tool and holder dimensions against the Controller window
tool and diameter compensation amounts. If the tool compensation amounts
do not agree with the tool definitions, a dialog will appear (as shown
at right) listing suggested tool compensation changes highlighted in
blue. Pressing OK will automatically adjust the tool compensation for
the selected tools.

When running VM with a Manufacturing Extractor, tools and holders will
be automatically created to match those used in the CAM manufacturing
program.

Tools
~~~~~

Select the Tools tab to add, modify or delete tool definitions.
Select the **New** button to define a new tool. Select an existing
tool definition to modify that tool. Select one or more tools and
press the **Delete** button to remove the selected tools.

The tool table lists the following information for each tool:

-  **ID**: Identifies the tool using the native form of tool numbering
   on the controller.

-  **Type**: Lists the tool type as defined when the tool was created or
   last modified.

-  **Unit**: Shows the units of measure used for non-angular tool
   dimensions.

-  **Lock**:
   Not used by CERUN, since it does not have the ability to automatically
   define tools.

-  **Default pocket**: Primarily used when simulating tool changers on
   models that define tool pocket locations. Double click on this field
   to choose the pocket where the tool will reside.

-  **Current pocket**: The current location of the tool. This field is
   updated dynamically by VM as tools are loaded. You can manually
   insert a tool into the spindle by double clicking on this field and
   selecting the primary tool axis.

Holders
~~~~~~~

Holder definitions add to simulation accuracy and realism. VM attaches
solid model representations of holders and tools to the spindle control
point (SCP). Once attached, they become a part of the collision
detection process. Holders are associated with tools using the Tools
dialog.

Note that the term “Holder” is used by VM to refer to a device used to
securely hold the tool in the spindle. The term “Head” is used by VM to
refer to detachable spindle units (e.g., a right angle head attachment).
The GENER HEAD keyword on a LOAD or TOOLNO command refers to a head
attachment, not the tool holder.

Select the Holders tab to add, modify or delete holder definitions.
Select the **New** button to define a new holder. Select an existing
holder definition to modify that holder. Select one or more holders
and press the **Delete** button to remove the selected holders.
Holders are associated with tools using the Tools dialog.

The holder table lists the following information for each holder:

-  **Name**: The name of the holder.

-  **Type**: Identifies the sub-type of the holder as being *Profile* (a
   holder defined by a 2D profile revolved about the spindle axis) or
   *Generic* (a holder defined by one or more STL meshes).

-  **Unit**: Defines the units of measure for non-angular holder
   dimensions.


.. _sim_head:

Heads
~~~~~

A head is a removable device that attaches to the machine and which
provides some form of extended machining capability. Common examples of
such devices are 90 degree angled heads that mount the tool at an angle,
long reach heads that extend the Z axis travel of the tool and heads
with one or more controllable rotary axes that provide 4 or 5-axis
control of the tool. Head devices (there can be multiple heads) are
predefined in the model.

The head table lists the following information for each head defined
in the model:

-  **ID**: Identifies the head using the native form of head numbering
   on the controller.

-  **Name**: Identifies the head using the name assigned by the creator
   of the VM model.

-  **Current station**: The current location of the head. This field is
   updated dynamically by VM as heads are loaded. You can manually load
   or park a head by double clicking on this field and selecting a head
   attachment point from the drop-down list.

Head attachment points are defined in the model with
QUEST.
Only one head at a time can reside at any single head attachment point.

A head must be attached to the machine (actually, to a head axis
identified as a “head socket”) for it to be active.

Heads do not have to be visible in the model. A head will not be shown
if its current selected station is “None”.

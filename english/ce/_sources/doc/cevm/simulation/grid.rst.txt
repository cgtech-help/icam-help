.. _sim_grid:

Simulation»Grid (Ctrl Alt G)
----------------------------

Activates the Grid dialog, which defines the boundaries and appearance
of the world. The Reset button resets the grid appearance and size to
reasonable values.

*Grid Units* can be set to any convenient value and need not match the
units used when the model was created. For optimal display and control,
the *Min/Max grid value* dimensions should exceed the dimensions of
the model itself. The *Grid subdivision size* defines the spacing of the
grid for visual clarity only (excessively small spacing can greatly
increase the CPU requirements during scene rendering). The
*Snap to grid* checkbox and associated input field define a rounding
factor that can optionally be used when interactively constructing
objects using the mouse pointer.

Select *Grid color* to set the color of the grid lines (the background
color is set in the Simulation»Options dialog Misc tab).

The main axis (model origin), grid contour boundary and grid subdivision
lines can all be toggled visible or invisible using the *Display Show*
checkboxes.

The coordinate frame marker size, color and style can also be controlled
from the Grid dialog. Three horizontal sliders control the size of the
arrow. Colors for each axis of the marker can be set in the *Colors* area.
The arrow style can be set using the *Arrow type* selection.

Enables the display of the Virtual Machine Simulation
Manager window if hidden or minimized. Hides the Simulation Manager
window if already active. This window can be toggled from the View
toolbar. The Simulation Manager window lists all of the components
included in the simulation (i.e., tools, parts, fixtures) and where
they are attached to the model. E.g., parts and fixtures will be
shown attached to stock mount points.

Double-clicking on a component or group header will activate a dialog
that permits modification of the selected component. As well, pressing
the right-mouse button on any component or group header will bring up a
context menu listing the actions that are available with the selected
entry.

-  **Tools:** Lists the tools defined in the simulation. Double-click
   the header to activate the Simulation»Tools/Holders/Heads dialog
   (see :ref:`here<sim_toolholderhead>`).
   Double-click a tool to view or modify it. Use the right-mouse context
   menu to change where tools are attached to the model.

   \

-  **Parts** and **Fixtures:** Lists the parts and fixtures defined in
   the simulation. Double-click the header to activate the
   Simulation»Parts/Fixtures dialog (see :ref:`here<sim_partfixture>`).
   Double-click a part or fixture to view or modify it. Use the
   right-mouse context menu to change where parts and fixtures are
   attached to the model.

   \

-  **Setups:** Lists the setups defined in the simulation. Double-click
   a setup to view it. Use the right-mouse context menu to add, copy or
   delete setups. Within each individual setup, use the right-mouse
   context menu to add or remove components from that setup as well as
   to modify the properties (e.g., position and orientation) of those
   components.    Setups are activated
   by calling the $FMSSETUP() macro function.

   \

-  **Model name:** Lists the components currently attached to the model
   tool and stock axes. Double-click a component to view or modify it.
   Use the right-mouse context menu to unload a component.

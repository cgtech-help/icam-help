      :width: 3.700in
      :align: right

   The Show Wireframe function switches between solid and wireframe
   rendering of the simulation window.

   Wireframe mode enables objects that are behind others to be seen.
   However, an object that is obscured by another still cannot be
   selected with the mouse pointer, even when in wireframe mode,
   because the selection is done on the faces of surfaces, not on their
   vertices.

   When looking at the backside of a surface in “solid” mode, the
   surface may appear as solid, or as wireframe, or invisible. This
   setting is controlled by the “Backface” options in the Simulation»Options
   dialog Misc tab.

.. _sim_show_tool_path:

Simulation»Show»Tool Path (Ctrl T)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../../../media/vm_tool_path.png
   :height: 0.542in
   :align: left
   :class: image-lowered

The Show Tool Path function shows or hides tool path tracing
in the simulation window. Tracing can also be toggled from the VM Tool
Path toolbar. Tracing shows the path of the tool with respect to the
part, and can appear at the tool-tip or the spindle control point.
Rotary motions may cause linear tool paths to appear as curves; this is
natural and reflects the actual path of the tool with respect to the
part.

The tool path trace shows different colors for rapid and feed motions.
The default is red for rapid positioning motions and green for all feed
interpolated motions. Tool paths modified in some form by SmartPATH,
SmartCUT and SmartFEED, can show different colors and dash styles to
indicate the type of modification. When using the “Synchronize” feature
from a Trace window, the Source window, the Time Line, or from an
in-process stock cut in the simulation window, then the corresponding
motion is instead traced in blue. Alternately, select any portion of a
tool-path trace with the right-mouse button and choose “Synchronize”
from the pop up menu, to synchronize all other windows to that moment in
time.

The trace can be limited to a specified elapsed time, or it can show the
tool path for a specified number of tools or operations, or for the
entire program. Trace options can be set in the VM Tool Path toolbar as
well as in the Simulation»Options dialog Tool path tab.

Simulation»Show»Tool Vector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Show Tool Vector function shows or hides the tool axis vector when
tool path tracing is enabled in the simulation window. Tool axis vector
tracing can also be toggled from the VM Tool Path toolbar. The length,
color and line style of the tool axis vector can be set in the
Simulation»Options dialog Tool path tab.

Simulation»Show»Tool Path as Overlay (Ctrl Shift T)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Selecting the Show Tool Path as Overlay function will ensure that the
tool path always remains visible, even when it would normally be hidden
behind other objects in the scene. The overlay setting can also be
toggled from the VM Tool Path toolbar.

The Show Axes Marker function shows or hides the axes arrows
that show the origin (i.e., 0,0,0 point) of the currently selected
object. These markers can also be toggled from the VM Grid toolbar.

By default, each axis appears in a different color; red for X, green for
Y and blue for Z. The axes marker color settings as well as the arrow
appearance and size can all be changed by selecting Simulation»Grid
(Ctrl Alt G).

.. _sim_show_kinematics:

Simulation»Show»Kinematics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Show Kinematics function shows or hides the markers that identify
all axes types except for Reference Axes. The visible marker types are
as follows:

-  A **linear axis** appears as a pale blue ribbon line with arrows at
   each end. The current axis position is indicated by a darker colored
   band.

-  A **rotary axis** appears as a light mauve ribbon arc, with a single
   arrow serving the dual purpose of pointing in the positive rotation
   direction and indicating the current position.

-  A **curve axis** appears as a dark mauve ribbon connecting each of
   the points in the curve axis profile. The current axis position is
   indicated by a lighter colored band.

-  A **tool axis** appears as two 2D profiles of a holder and tool; one
   aligned with the X axis and the other with the Y axis.

-  A **stock axis** appears as a gold colored rectangle, with an
   internal red-green-blue coordinate frame marker.

-  A **head axis** appears as a gold colored 2D profile of a 90º head.

-  A **reference axis** appears as a red-green-blue coordinate frame
   marker.

   .. image:: ../../../media/vm_grid_work_ref_button.png
      :height: 0.219in

   The **Workpiece Reference** toggles the display of a marker
   in the simulation window showing the origin and orientation of the
   workpiece coordinate frame. This frame includes the effects of fixture
   compensation, RTCP and any local coordinate system (LCS).

.. container:: icon-bullet

   .. image:: ../../../media/vm_grid_tool_ref_button.png
      :height: 0.219in

   The **Tool Reference** toggles the display of a marker in the
   simulation window showing the offset at the spindle control point (SCP)
   due to the effects of tool length or tool offset compensation.

The reference markers can also be toggled from the VM Grid toolbar.

.. _sim_show_safety_zones:

Simulation»Show»Safety Zones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Show Safety Zones function enables or disables the display of the
safety zone that surrounds any collision enabled object that also has a
safety clearance distance defined. The safety zone appears as a
transparent light blue surface, offset from the original surface by the
safety distance.

An object’s safety zone is always shown in transparent orange when
another collision-enabled object touches it, regardless of the Show
Safety Zones setting. Colliding objects are always shown in transparent
red. The intersection between colliding objects is shown as a bright
yellow line, unless this feature is disabled in the Simulation»Options
dialog (Ctrl Alt O).

Safety zone visibility can also be toggled from the VM Grid toolbar.

.. _sim_show_workpiece_coords:

Simulation»Show»Workpiece Coords (Ctrl W)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Show Workpiece Coords function toggles between the display of linear
axes values and workpiece linear coordinates in both the Controller Axes
tab and the simulation window HUD. When workpiece coordinates are
enabled, the linear axes are labeled Xw, Yw and Zw. The value shown is
the distance from the local coordinate system (LCS) origin.

.. _sim_show_display:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Display menu selection shows or hides the “heads-up”
status display that floats in front of the simulation window. The HUD
lists the status of various components of the machine (e.g., current
tool, axes positions, feed rate). The content of the heads-up displays
(there can be many) are defined by selecting Simulation»Display
(Ctrl Alt D) described :ref:`here<sim_display>`.

Display menu choices are stored in the Windows Registry; not with the
model or the “.vsw” setup file.

During CERUN processing, you can cycle between the various display
content types using the Next Display (Ctrl D) and Previous Display
(Ctrl Shift D) menu selections.

The heads-up display can also be cycled from the CERUN VM Mode toolbar.

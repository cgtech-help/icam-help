Time Line Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These options control the behavior, display and contents of the Time
Line window.

-  **Use Time Line animation** when set causes the Time Line window to
   smoothly interpolate when changing the time-scale or when using F3,
   Shift F3 or the Synchronize feature to jump from one moment in time
   to another.

   \

-  **Use Time Line color label** when set causes the Time Line window
   labels to be shown in various colors depending on the type of data.
   Clear this checkbox to have labels appear in a uniform high contrast
   color.

   \

-  **Include probe touch events in Time Line find** affects the behavior
   of the F3 and Shift F3 search function in the Time Line window. When
   set, searching for collisions will stop at probe touch events. When
   the checkbox is cleared, probe events are ignored for search
   purposes.

   \

-  **Include start and end in Time Line find** affects the behavior of
   the F3 and Shift F3 search function in the Time Line window. When
   set, searching forward past the last event of the type being searched
   will position to the end of the Time Line window; searching backwards
   before the first event will position to the start of the Time Line
   window. When the checkbox is cleared, attempts to search beyond the
   last (or before the first) event will result in no action.

   \

-  **Show tooltip in Time Line** when set enables the display of
   tooltips, which describe events of interest under the cursor (e.g.,
   collision, tool…). Tooltips identify the start and ending time of the
   event as well as other pertinent information.

   \

-  **Limit Time Line memory** and its associated input field can be used
   to avoid out-of-memory conditions on very large programs. If set,
   the Time Line window will only use the specified amount of memory to
   track the events of the model. Once the limit has been reached,
   events earlier in the program will no longer be accessible via the
   Time Line window.

   \

-  **Default view size** sets the minimum width (in minutes) of the Time
   Line display at the start of a new process.

   \

-  The **Show** checkboxes list the types of information desired in the
   Time Line window. This can also be done in the Time Line window
   itself, using the right-mouse button context menu.

   \

-  **Color code** controls define the color to use for the horizontal
   bars in the Time Line window. A “Use cut color” setting for Tools
   will use the same color in the Time Line as is used for material
   removal simulation on the in-process stock.

Tool Path Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These options control the display of the tool path trace in the
simulation window. The trace appears as a thin line, with different
colors representing interpolation and positioning. Many of the tool
path options can be also be controlled from the Tool Path toolbar.

-  **Show tool path trace** shows or hides tool-path tracing.

   \

-  **Show tool vector** shows or hides tracing of the tool-axis vector
   when tool path tracing is active.

   \

-  When the **Use overlay** checkbox is selected, the tool path trace
   will not be hidden by objects that might be between you (the viewer)
   and the tool path.

   \

-  **Tool tip** and **SCP** trace settings selects whether the trace will
   be drawn at the tool tip or at the spindle control point (SCP).
   Tooling must have a length to see a difference between the tool-tip and
   SCP traces. This setting has no effect on a tool path that is already
   drawn.

   \

-  **Mode** settings select the extent of the tool path trace.

   -  **Up to current time**: Traces the entire tool path from the start of
      the program.
   -  **seconds**: Traces the tool path for the specified last number of
      seconds.
   -  **tool changes**: Traces the tool path for the specified last number
      of tool changes.
   -  **operations**: Traces the tool path for the specified last number of
      operations.

   Tool path trace mode settings are also available from the VM
   Tool Path toolbar. Clear the 3 rightmost toggles to trace the entire
   tool path from the start of the program.

   \

-  **Motion style** settings provide the ability to set the color, line
   style and line width of tool path traces for various types of
   motions.

   \

-  **Tool vector** settings provide the ability to set the color, line
   style and line width of the tool axis vector trace.

MRS Options
~~~~~~~~~~~

These options provide control over the in-process stock; functionality
that requires a Material Removal Simulation (MRS) license\ [#]_.

-  **In-process stock checkpoints** settings control the visualization
   of the in-process stock when moving Time Line backwards and forwards.
   If checkpoints are enabled and Simulation»Show»Filters»Stock
   Checkpoints is toggled on, then the in-process stock will update to
   show its state at earlier moments in time when moving Time Line
   backwards and forwards. The frequency of checkpoints can be
   controlled as follows:

   -  **At each tool change**: Creates a checkpoint at every tool change.
   -  **At each operation**: Creates a checkpoint at the start of every
      operation.
   -  **Periodically during long cutting sequences**: Creates a checkpoint
      after the specified number of motions have been processed.

   \

-  **Flute length optimization** settings control the analysis and
   reporting of optimal tool flute lengths during the simulation. If
   active, the defined and maximum required flute lengths will be
   reported in the listing file at the end of CERUN processing.

   -  **On**: Enables flute length optimization.
   -  **Off**: Disables flute length optimization.
   -  **Automatic**: Flute length optimization is under control of the
      $FMSADPT('DEPTH') macro function
      (see the *“Virtual Machine Users Guide”*).
   -  **Extra body length**: For ON only, specifies an extended flute
      length to use for analysis purposes. The maximum detectable flute
      length is the sum of the actual flute length and this value.

   \

-  **Automatic chip removal** settings control the automatic removal of
   disconnected in-process stock chips (i.e., fragments) during the
   simulation.

   -  **Remove chips not intersecting the design**: When the in-process
      stock is fragmented, independent fragments that do not intersect
      the part are removed.
   -  **Remove chips with volume less than**: When the in-process stock
      is fragmented, independent fragments with a volume less than the
      specified amount are removed.

   \

-  **Plane offset step size** sets the amount to offset the cross
   section plane when selecting Push Plane or Pull Plane on the Cross
   Section toolbar.

.. [#] The Multi-core speed optimization option in older releases is no
   longer shown as it is permanently enabled.

   :width: 3.383in
   :align: right

.. _sim_options_tolerances:

Tolerance Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Define tolerance using** specifies the units of measure for all
   tolerance values listed.

   \

-  **Gouge tolerance** specifies an acceptable collision tolerance
   between the cutting portion of the tool and the part model. Some
   gouging is to be expected, which is normally a function of the
   manufacturing tolerance used by the CAM system. When the Material
   Removal Simulation (MRS) license option is enabled, the gouge
   tolerance also defines the cutting tolerance to use when computing
   the in-process stock. The actual cutting tolerance used is a function
   of the gouge tolerance and tool usage (see :ref:`tool “Usage” description<sim_toolholderhead>`).

   \

-  **Collision tolerance** specifies the accuracy in space of the
   beginning and end of a collision event between two objects.

   \

-  **Faceting tolerance** specifies the accuracy of mesh objects
   generated at run-time from swept profiles. A tighter tolerance
   produces more accurate results, but at the cost of increased memory
   and CPU. One of the key uses of the faceting tolerance is in the
   generation of 3D tooling given either a 2D profile or tool definition
   parameters (i.e., diameter, corner radius, length…).

   \

-  **Tool path resolution** defines the tolerance to use when
   approximating curved motions by short straight-line segments.

Miscellaneous Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Rendering** settings affect the simulation graphic quality. This
   has no effect on collision and overtravel checking. The settings are
   dependent upon the computer’s GPU.

   \

-  **Animation control** settings affect the simulation display speed.

   -  **Continuous**: Select this method to slow the simulation down to
      some Scale factor of real time (within the limitations of the CPU
      and graphics capabilities of your computer). Select *Motion Step
      during Tool Change* to speed up the animation of tool changes.
   -  **Motion Step**: Select this method to update the Virtual Machine
      window at the endpoint of every *Step Size* motions.
   -  **Time Interval**: Select this method to only update the Virtual
      Machine window at a set Interval in seconds. This method has the
      least impact in terms of CPU requirements.

   .. image:: ../../../media/vm_animation_control.png
      :height: 0.583in
      :align: left
      :class: image-lowered

   Animation control settings are also available from the VM
   Animation toolbar. When in continuous animation mode, extremely slow
   motions may give the impression that the software is no longer
   operating. If unsure, activate the HUD motion display, which will show
   if axes are in fact moving. Animation control settings can be changed
   while the simulation is running (and even mid interpolation).

   \

-  **World background color** setting control the underlying color of
   all simulation windows.

   -  **Use gradient** can be selected to use a two-color smooth
      gradient background.
   -  **Top** defines the background color if gradient fill is not
      selected, or the color to use at the upper edge of the simulation
      windows when using a gradient fill background.
   -  **Bottom** defines the color to use at the lower edge of the
      simulation windows when using a gradient fill background.

   \

-  **Backface** settings control how the backside of a surface should be
   shown. VM uses a mesh of triangles to represent objects. Each
   triangle has a concept of in and out, which is used in the drawing
   process to correctly color and shade the triangle. When an object is
   viewed from the inside looking out, VM provides the following choices
   on how the backside surface should be displayed:

   -  **Wireframe**: An object’s surface will be drawn in wireframe mode
      when viewed from the inside. This setting may result in faint lines
      appearing at the edges of objects. Some graphic cards exhibit poor
      performance in this mode.
   -  **Solid**: An object’s surface will be drawn as a solid when viewed
      from the inside (this setting is only valid when not in
      Simulation»Show»Wireframe mode).
   -  **Hidden**: An object’s surface will be hidden when viewed from the
      inside.

   \

.. _options_misc:

-  **Miscellaneous** settings include the following:

   -  **Use 3D construction positioning** controls the operation of the
      left-mouse button when constructing objects. When set, it takes two
      mouse clicks to define a point in space: the first defines the XY
      location and the second defines the Z. When the 3D checkbox is clear,
      the first mouse-click defines the XYZ coordinates.
   -  **Default to Look-Around camera** sets the default mode of camera
      rotation. When set, camera rotation by default rotates around the
      current camera position (like turning your head) and the Shift key
      must be pressed to rotate around a point in space in front of the
      camera. When this checkbox is clear, the default is the reverse. The
      camera will rotate around a point in space in front of the camera and
      the Shift key will cause the camera to rotate around the current
      position.
   -  **Use camera animation** when set causes the camera to smoothly
      interpolate between any two user-defined viewpoints sharing the same
      type (i.e., perspective vs. orthogonal). When this checkbox is
      cleared, the camera jumps directly to each new viewpoint.
   -  **Default to Camera mode** sets the default functionality
      of the left-mouse button. When set, the default is “Camera” mode;
      meaning that the left-mouse button controls the orientation of the
      camera and the Ctrl key must be held down to select objects. When
      this checkbox is clear, the default is “Selection” mode; meaning that
      the left-mouse button is used to select objects and the Ctrl key must
      be held down to orient the camera.The Camera and Selection mode
      defaults can also be set using the camera and pointer buttons
      on the VM Mode toolbar.
   -  **Enable $FMSCMRA and CAMERA pp command** when set allows the active
      simulation window viewpoint to be changed under program control,
      using the
      CAMERA post-processor command
      (GENER only) or the Virtual Machine
      $FMSCMRA macro function.
      Clear this checkbox to inhibit viewpoint changes under program control.
   -  **Show collision interference** when set will dynamically show, as a
      yellow line, the intersection between colliding objects. Computing
      the intersection takes considerably more CPU than simply detecting if
      a collision has occurred. You can disable the viewing of collision
      interference if you encounter unacceptable performance with colliding
      objects on complex scenes.

   \

-  The **Video Options** button calls up a *Video Compression* dialog
   listing the various Compressor methods that can be used for recording
   the contents of the active simulation window when selecting the
   Simulation»Annotation»Record menu function. These compressor methods,
   called “codecs” (short for compressor/decompressor), use various
   techniques to reduce the size of the final recording file. Links to a
   selection of codecs that have been tested by the ICAM Support team
   can be found on the customer portal section of the ICAM web site.

   \

-  **Mouse Scheme** overrides Virtual Machine’s default selection,
   panning, rotation and zoom features (called “ICAM Classic”) and uses
   instead the mouse and keyboard controls of the selected CAM system.
   The “ICAM 3DM” scheme is designed for use with a 3D mouse; it
   supports unrestricted view rotation and pans the model instead of the
   camera.

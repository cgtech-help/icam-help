Activates the Lights dialog, which is used to control one headlight and
up to 6 separately movable light sources. VM lights are not affected by
solid objects. Lights shine through objects, do not cast shadows and the
lights themselves are not visible in the simulation window (but they are
visible in the Lights dialog to simplify placement). The Reset button
sets all lights to default positions around the extremity of the grid.
Lights should be reset whenever the underlying grid is reset (see
:ref:`Simulation»Grid<sim_grid>`). The horizontal slider rotates your viewpoint
around the machine. The vertical slider changes the viewing distance.

VM provides a headlight that is located behind the camera and is
directed into the scene. This optional light source makes it easier to
view the workpiece or machine from the rear of the model; areas of the
simulation environment where typical light placement does not reach.
Because this light is mounted behind the camera, you cannot use it to
differentiate the edges of identically colored and aligned faces. Two or
more movable light sources must be placed around the model to be able to
differentiate object edges.

Moveable lights appear as small spheres, but you may have to hide the
machine (clear the *Objects* checkbox) to see them. Lights are positioned
on a hemisphere using the left and right-mouse buttons. The left-mouse
button controls the position on the hemisphere. The right-mouse button
controls the size of the hemisphere. To adjust the light, place the
mouse pointer over the light and then press and hold either the left or
the right-mouse button. Move the mouse to change the lighting position
or distance. Light intensity is controlled by the individual sliders
associated with each light. The color of each light can be adjusted by
first selecting the box to the right of the intensity slider and then
choosing a color from the color chart. Using different colors for your
light sources will improve depth perception.

If a light appears immovable, the distance may have been set to a very
small value. In this case, use the right-mouse button to increase the
lighting distance. It is also possible to position a light so far away
that it can no longer be selected. In this case, the Reset button can be
used to set all lights to their default positions.

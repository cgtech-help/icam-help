CERUN with Virtual Machine
**************************

ICAM’s control emulator run-time **CERUN** emulates the MCD
processing and movements of a CNC machine, based on information
previously entered (using the QUEST developer’s module) about the
machine and controller combination.

This chapter provides details about CERUN and its Virtual Machine
interface, used for both machine simulation and in-process stock
material removal simulation.

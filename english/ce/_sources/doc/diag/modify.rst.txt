Modifying Diagnostic Messages
=============================

Several methods are available to modify diagnostic message behavior and output.

-  The :ref:`ERROR macro command<macro_command_error>` can be used to output a diagnostic message
   given a particular diagnostic number.


   \

-  The :ref:`$ERRMSG macro system variable<var_errmsg>` can be used to completely disable
   diagnostic messages.

   \

-  The :ref:`$FERSEV macro function<func_fersev>` can be used to get or set the diagnostic
   severity associated with a particular diagnostic number.

   \

-  The :ref:`$FERSTA macro function<func_fersta>` can be used to get or set the diagnostic
   enabled/disabled state associated with a particular diagnostic number.

The above facilities are run-time options to alter diagnostic message
handling for a particular job. The cer260.err file provided with the
Control Emulator installation can be used as a starting point (see :ref:`next section<error_file>`)
to permanently alter standard diagnostic message severity
and/or text, or add new diagnostic messages.

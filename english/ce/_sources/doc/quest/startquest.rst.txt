Starting QUEST
==============

This section explains how to start QUEST from the desktop as well as
from the Windows command prompt.

Starting QUEST from the Desktop
-------------------------------

QUEST may be started either from the Start menu or from the ICAM
Portal.

To start QUEST from the Start menu, first locate the “ICAM V26 x64”
Start menu, then select “Quest V26”. To start QUEST from the
portal, select the Products pane and click on the “ICAM QUEST
Developer” tile or icon.

You can drag-and-drop dedicated control emulators and exported
control emulators onto a running portal application or the portal desktop icon.
QUEST will load the control emulators into the default database (if one exists).

Starting QUEST from a Command Prompt
------------------------------------

QUEST can be started from a Windows command prompt by first setting
the current working directory to the Control Emulator V26 installation
directory (i.e., C:\\Program Files\\ICAM\\V26) and then typing the
following command:

   :math:`\textbf{quest }
   \Big[\,\mathit{file}\textnormal{-}\mathit{name}\,
   \big[\,\mathit{file}\textnormal{-}\mathit{name…}\,\big]\,\Big] \;
   \mathit{qualifiers}`

You can optionally specify one or more files on the QUEST command
line, to have QUEST perform special actions in a “batch” mode of
operation. QUEST looks at the content of each file specified and then
performs the appropriate action. The full QUEST interface is not
activated when QUEST is run in a batch mode. The files that QUEST
recognizes for batch operation are:

-  Dedicated control emulators (*dp*) are loaded into the default or
   specified database.

-  Exported control emulators (*dmp*) are loaded into the default or
   specified database.

If files are not specified on the QUEST command line, the full QUEST
interface will be started, which you can use to maintain and create
control emulators.

.. _quest_qualifiers:

qualifiers
~~~~~~~~~~

The command line qualifiers are keyword value pairs separated by an
**=** (equal sign). The qualifier keywords must be preceded with a
**/** (forward slash). The following is an alphabetical list of
optional command qualifiers and their usage:

:math:`\textbf{/dbf}\mathtt{=}\mathit{file}\textnormal{-}\mathit{name}`

   Specifies the database file name. By default, the database is named
   campost.dbf and resides in the work subdirectory of the *icam_appdata*
   directory (see :ref:`“Configuration Storage and Application Data”<configuration_storage>`).
   The *icam_dbf* environment variable can also be used to define the database.

:math:`\textbf{/def}\mathtt{=}\mathit{file}\textnormal{-}\mathit{name}`

   Specifies which definition file to use. By default, the definition
   file is named ICAM.DEF and resides in the *icam_appdata* directory.
   If a directory path is not specified with the file name, then QUEST
   will search for the file as described :ref:`here<configuration_storage>`.

:math:`\textbf{/ef}\mathtt{=}\mathit{file}\textnormal{-}\mathit{name}`

   This qualifier specifies the name of a log file echoing the error
   messages generated during the execution of QUEST.

:math:`\textbf{/words}\mathtt{=}\mathit{file}\textnormal{-}\mathit{name}`

   If specified, QUEST will use the words list supplied. The words list
   defines Major and Minor words and their associated codes. This list
   can be created and modified from the QUEST Tools»Words Manager
   menu-bar selection. By default, QUEST uses
   a file named *dwords.dat* in the *icam_appdata* directory.

   This qualifier will override the *words* symbol if specified in the
   ICAM.DEF file.

Importing Control Emulators
-------------------------------

QUEST can be used in a batch mode of operation to import dedicated
control emulators (*dp* file type) and exported control emulators (*dmp*
file type) into the default or specified database. Control emulators
can be imported simply by dragging and by dropping the control emulator
file (*dp* or *dmp*) onto a running portal application or the portal
desktop icon.

The import operation can also be executed from a Windows command
prompt by first setting the current working directory to the Control Emulator
V26 installation directory (i.e., C:\\Program Files\\ICAM\\V26) and
then typing either of the following commands:

   :math:`\textbf{quest } \,
   \mathit{file}\textnormal{-}\mathit{name}\ \,
   \big[\,\mathit{file}\textnormal{-}\mathit{name…}\,\big] \;
   \mathit{qualifiers}`

   :math:`\textbf{quest }
   \textbf{/dp}\mathtt{=}\mathit{file}\textnormal{-}\mathit{name} \;\,
   \mathit{qualifiers}`

The command line qualifiers are keyword value pairs separated by an
**=** (equal sign). The qualifier keywords must be preceded with a
**/** (forward slash). The **dp** qualifier is an older optional way
of telling QUEST to import a control emulator. Do not mix the old and
new methods on a single command line:

:math:`\textbf{/dp}\mathtt{=}\mathit{file}\textnormal{-}\mathit{name}`

   Specifies the name of the control emulator file. If a file type is
   omitted, QUEST will assume a file type of *dp*.

See :ref:`“QUEST Qualifiers”<quest_qualifiers>` above for an
alphabetical list of optional QUEST qualifiers and their usage.

Creating a Database Listing
---------------------------

QUEST can create a database listing, which you can use for your own
purposes. The database listing contains the names of generated
post-processors and control emulators, listed one per line with their
associated titles. The listing also contains the names of any Virtual
Machine models present in the database (models do not have titles).
From a Windows command prompt first set the current working directory
to the Control Emulator V26 installation directory (i.e., C:\\Program Files\\ICAM\\V26)
and then type the following command:

   :math:`\textbf{quest }
   \textbf{/list}\mathtt{=}\mathit{file}\textnormal{-}\mathit{name} \;
   \big[\,\mathit{match\_pattern}\,\big] \;
   \mathit{qualifiers}`

:math:`\textbf{/list}\mathtt{=}\mathit{file}\textnormal{-}\mathit{name}`

   The **list** qualifier must be specified to obtain a database
   listing. The optional file name specifies the name of the database
   listing output file. QUEST will add a file type of *lis* if missing
   from the file name. By default, the database listing is written to a
   scrolling window.

The **match_pattern** is a regular expression, in the same style as
is used with the $FMATCH macro command, which can optionally be used
to list only those objects whose database descriptors match
the specified criteria.
For example, a match pattern of ``M3`` would list only generated
post-processors and control emulators for 3-axis milling machines.

See :ref:`“QUEST Qualifiers”<quest_qualifiers>` above for an
alphabetical list of optional QUEST qualifiers and their usage.

Installation Content
====================

Installation directory
----------------------

The installation root directory contains a number of small executable
files:

-  The executable files are simple generically named wrappers (i.e.,
   **config.exe**, **cerun.exe**, **portal.exe**, **quest.exe**) that in
   turn execute the appropriate program stored in the **bin**
   subdirectory tree.

-  An **icamid.exe** utility can be run to get the computer’s ICAM
   system ID for licensing purposes.

The following subdirectories are located in the installation
directory:

-  The **basic** subdirectory contains basic control emulators. Basic
   control emulators are used to simplify QUEST control emulator development
   by supplying intelligent defaults for the most common machine types
   and controls. The basic subdirectory is not used by CERUN.

-  The **bin/win32** and **bin/win64** subdirectories contain 32-bit and
   64-bit system dependent binary, data and executable files. These
   system dependent subdirectories include a **lang** subdirectory
   containing files related to the different languages supported by the
   product.

-  The **cepp** subdirectory contains html help information for each of
   the pre-processors supported by Control Emulator. Pre-processors have
   built-in logic to handle special processing requirements (e.g.,
   variables and program flow) of common CNC controllers.

-  The **documentation** subdirectory contains ICAM product User Guides.
   This directory can be accessed from the software using the
   Help»Documentation menu selection.

-  The **images** subdirectory contains images used by QUEST.

-  The **integration** subdirectory contains the software and components
   necessary to
   extract CAM system manufacturing data for use within a Virtual
   Machine simulation.

-  The **kit** subdirectory contains
   CAM interface information used by post-processing.
   This is not used by Control Emulator.

.. _application_data_directory:

Application Data Directory
--------------------------

A portion of the ICAM installation is written to an ICAM\\260
subdirectory in the user’s roaming application data or common
ProgramData directory. This ICAM application data directory holds
various configuration files:

-  An **ICAM.DEF** file contains all configuration settings. This file
   must be present.

-  A **dwords.dat** file contains default Major and Minor keywords.

-  An **icam.key** file contains licensing server connection information.

The following subdirectories are located in the application data directory:

-  The **cache** subdirectory contains cached files used by Virtual
   Machine to reduce the time it takes to reload a job. This directory
   and/or its contents can be deleted at any time.

-  The **kit** subdirectory contains any customized interface
   kits used by the Icam Post post-processor.
   Control Emulator does not use interface kits.

-  The **macros** subdirectory contains user macro functions that can be
   shared by multiple control emulators, post-processors and models.

-  The **samples** subdirectory contains various samples that may be of
   interest. These include examples of milling, mill-turn and robotic
   manufacturing processes, an example of automatic generation of shop
   documentation, a library of Virtual Machine models, and some examples
   of external macros for developers.

-  The **work** subdirectory contains one or more database files
   containing control emulators, post-processors and virtual machine
   models. The icam_dbf environment variable must be used if the
   database is placed elsewhere or if it has a custom name.

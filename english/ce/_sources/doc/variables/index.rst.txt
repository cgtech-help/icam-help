Macro System Variables
**********************

This chapter lists the macro system variables available for use in CERUN macros. All variables
return a value, but those identified as read-only cannot be assigned a value. Variables are organized
in groups.

The first section summarizes the various variables by category.

**Syntax Format Conventions**

Special notation is used to simplify the listing of a series of similar variable names. Square brackets
[ ] enclose a list of characters of which one may be optionally selected; and braces { } enclose a list
of characters of which one must be selected. For example, $[AB]C{DE} is short for $CD, $CE,
$ACD, $ACE, $BCD and $BCE.

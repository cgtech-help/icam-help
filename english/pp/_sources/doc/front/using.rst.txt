+++++++++++++++++

**Icam Post** is a Numerical Control (NC) post-processor generator designed for end users having
no software programming expertise. It can accommodate a wide variety
of machine types having up to six axes of continuous path control.

Icam Post consists of two parts: QUEST and GENER.

-  **QUEST** is an interactive program that builds a database containing
   information entered about one or more CNC (computer numerically
   controlled) machines.

   \

-  **GENER** uses this database, along with the CL (cutter location)
   files generated by an APT or CAM system, to produce the MCD (machine
   control data, also commonly called tape) for each particular machine.

This manual describes the complete Icam Post product, organized as
follows.

   describes the steps necessary to install, upgrade,
   and configure your system to run this latest release of Icam Post.

   \

-  :ref:`“QUEST: Post-Processor Development”<quest_section>`
   describes the use of the post-processor
   development tool QUEST. This section is only of interest to those
   sites licensed for full development and those persons responsible for
   post-processor creation at a site. It includes instructions on how
   to run QUEST, details of the QUEST system, macro programming
   references and other information useful to developers.

   \

-  :ref:`“GENER: The Post-Processor”<gener_section>`
   describes the use of the post-processor
   itself, named GENER. It includes instructions on how to run GENER,
   details of the post-processor vocabulary (i.e., command syntax), and
   other items of note concerning day to day use of the GENER product.

Following these sections are:
a :ref:`“Glossary”<glossary>` of terms used in this manual;
an :ref:`“Appendix”<appendix>` listing information of possible interest to both users and developers alike; and
an :ref:`“Index”<genindex>`.

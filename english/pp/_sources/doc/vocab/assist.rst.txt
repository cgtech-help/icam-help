The ASSIST Command :kbd:`[PC]`
==============================

The ASSIST command is used to control gas flow for contouring
machines and hybrid punch press machines with contouring attachments.

   :math:`\textbf{ ASSIST /} \begin{pmatrix} \begin{array}{l} \textbf{AIR} \\ \textbf{OXYGEN} \\ \textbf{ARGON} \\ \textbf{NITRGN} \end{array} \end{pmatrix}`

   :math:`\textbf{ ASSIST /} \begin{pmatrix} \begin{array}{l} \textbf{ON} \\ \textbf{OFF} \end{array} \end{pmatrix}`

The first form is used to activate one of four types of gas flow for
the machine. Note that ARGON and NITRGN are only supported for
machines with laser attachments.

The second form is used to stop and restart assist gases. If
ASSIST/ON is coded at the start of a program before a specific type
is established, the QUEST specified default type will be used.

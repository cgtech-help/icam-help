.. _command_stop:

The STOP Command :kbd:`[MLEPC]`
===============================

The STOP command is used to stop all machine movement when coded in
the part program, typically using an M00 code. This command is valid
for all machine types.

   :math:`\textbf{STOP}`

GENER will output a code to stop all movement of the machine. For
punches, if the STOP code turns punching off, GENER may optionally
turn it back on when the machine is restarted. For other machine
types, GENER may also output codes to stop the spindle and/or the
coolant flow if this is not done automatically by the control. This
action will be determined by the responses to QUEST. Codes might also
be output to restart the spindle and/or the coolant flow following
the STOP (M) code.

A TMARK block will also be output if the AUTO option has been
programmed on a TMARK command.

The LOADTL Command :kbd:`[MLEP]`
================================

The LOADTL command is a non-standard\ [#]_ alias for the
LOAD/WIRE, LOAD/TOOL and LOAD/ HEAD commands. It is used to: thread
and cut the wire on a wire EDM; select the active punch tools for
punch presses; and load and unload tools and heads on mills and
lathes.

Wire EDM machines:
------------------

   :math:`\textbf{LOADTL / } \mathit{tool\_id}`

Specify a positive non-zero *tool_id* to cause the wire to be
threaded at the current position; specify a zero (0) tool id to cause
the wire to be cut (or use the UNLOAD/WIRE command).

Punch Press machines:
---------------------

   :math:`\textbf{LOADTL / } \mathit{tool\_id}`

Specify a positive non-zero *tool_id* to cause the punch tool to be
changed.

Mill and Lathe machines:
------------------------

   :math:`\textbf{LOADTL / }
   \big[\,\mathtt{<\!tool\_information\!>}\,\big] \;
   \big[,\textbf{HEAD}, \mathtt{<\!head\_information\!>}\,\big]`

See :ref:`the TOOLNO command<command_toolno>` for
a description of the tool and head information parameters. See :ref:`the LOAD/TOOL command<command_load>` for more
information on loading tools and heads.

If the *tool_id* on the LOADTL command matches the tool currently
loaded, and the tool register contains combined tool and offset
information, then a tool change operation will not be generated.
However, changes in tool length, tool offset and orientation will be
respected. In all other cases a redundant tool change will be output.

.. [#] International Standards Organization ISO 4343:1972 defined LOADTL
   as a standard post-processor command, but this was later revised to
   LOAD/TOOL in the ISO 4343:2000 update.

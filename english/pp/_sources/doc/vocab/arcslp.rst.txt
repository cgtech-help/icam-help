The ARCSLP Command :kbd:`[MLEPC]`
=================================

The ARCSLP command is used to control the type of output resulting
from a circular motion command.

2D Arc Control
--------------

   :math:`\textbf{ARCSLP /} \begin{pmatrix} \begin{array}{l} \textbf{ON} \\ \textbf{OFF} \end{array} \end{pmatrix}`

The basic ARCSLP command controls the output of 2D circles, which are
arcs that lie on one of the major planes (XY, YZ, ZX) of the machine.
This command is ignored if 2D planar arcs are not supported by the
machine. ON will cause all 2D planar circular motions to be output
using circular interpolation (this is the default). OFF will cause
all 2D planar circular motions to be approximated using linear
interpolation (i.e., point to point motions).

3D Arc Control
--------------

   :math:`\textbf{ ARCSLP / XYZ}, \begin{pmatrix} \begin{array}{l} \textbf{ALL} \\ \textbf{ON} \\ \textbf{OFF} \end{array} \end{pmatrix}`

The ARCSLP/XYZ command controls the output of 3D circles, which are
arcs that *do not* lie on one of the major planes (XY, YZ, ZX) of the
machine. This command is ignored if 3D arcs are not supported by the
machine. ALL will cause any circular motion, 2D or 3D, to be output
using the 3D arc format. ON will cause 3D arcs to be output using the
3D arc format (this is the default). OFF disables the output of 3D
arc interpolation, in which case 3D arcs will be approximated using
linear interpolation (i.e., point to point motions).

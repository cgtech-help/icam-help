The INDPOS Command :kbd:`[ML]`
==============================

This command defines a safe machine location to position to when
moving rotary axes at high speed. It is valid for mills with rotary
axes, or mill-turn lathes while in milling mode.

   :math:`\textbf{INDPOS /} \!
   \icamrange{2.6}{1}\! \begin{pmatrix}
   \begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{l} \textbf{XAXIS} \\ \textbf{YAXIS} \\ \textbf{ZAXIS} \end{array}\end{pmatrix}
   ,\mathit{value} \end{pmatrix}`

   :math:`\textbf{INDPOS / NOMORE}`

The XAXIS, YAXIS, ZAXIS syntax is used to specify the position in
machine coordinates. Note that the keyword XAXIS will refer to the
X-axis or to the U-axis, depending on which is currently active. The
same applies to the Y-axis and the Z-axis.

When INDPOS is coded before a ROTABL command, the machine will move
to the requested position and then execute the rotary move. The tool
will not engage the part until another motion is requested. When
INDPOS is coded before a MULTAX move, the tool will move to the index
position, move the rotary axes and then move the linear axes to
complete the requested move.

The INDPOS command is modal. That is, once an indexing position has
been declared, the tool will always move to that position before
performing any rotary moves. The tool will continue to do so until
the INDPOS/NOMORE command has been issued.

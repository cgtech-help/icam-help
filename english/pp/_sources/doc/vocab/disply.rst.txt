The DISPLY Command :kbd:`[MLEPC]`
=================================

The DISPLY command is used to display text messages on the control’s
CRT. This command is valid for all machine types but may not be
available on a specific machine.

   :math:`\textbf{DISPLY / }
   \big[\,\textbf{NEXT},\big] \;
   \mathtt{'}\mathit{string}\,\mathtt{'} \;
   \,\icamrange{0.8}{0}\, \big[,\mathit{value}\,\big]`

   :math:`\textbf{DISPLY /}
   \begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{l} \textbf{ON} \\ \textbf{OFF} \end{array}\end{pmatrix}`

The DISPLY command can be used to send instructions to the machine
operator concerning such areas as tool changes, feed rates and so on.
GENER will structure the text to specifications given in QUEST as to
length of lines, number of lines displayed and possible truncation.

There are two methods of outputting text messages to be displayed at
the control’s CRT.

The first method allows you to enter the character string with
optional parameter values formatted into the string using the format specifications
described in :ref:`“String Formatting”<string_formatting>`.
String formatting can be disabled if desired using the PPFUN/17 command
described in :ref:`“PPFUN 17: String Formatting”<string_formatting_ppfun>`.
The text will be output by GENER to the CRT of the control. If NEXT is
specified and operator messages can be intermixed with other data on
a block of MCD, then the message will be appended to the next MCD
block output. Otherwise, the message will appear on a block alone.

The second method uses the parameters ON and OFF together with
upcoming PPRINT commands. When DISPLY/ON is coded in the CL file, all
subsequent PPRINT commands will be interpreted as DISPLY commands.
The PPRINT messages will then be directed to the CRT of the control
and also will appear in the verification listing. This redirection
will continue until a DISPLY/OFF command is encountered. PPRINT
commands will then be treated as regular PPRINT commands and be
output in the verification listing.

The PENUP Command :kbd:`[MLEPC]`
================================

The PENUP command is always used in conjunction with the PLOT
command. It is used to suspend output to a backplot file.

   :math:`\textbf{PENUP}`

The PLOT command opens a file called a backplot file, to which are
output CL records of the moves generated by the post-processor.
Occasionally, the programmer may wish to suspend output to this
backplot file temporarily and then restart the output later. The
PENUP command will suspend output to the backplot file in such cases.

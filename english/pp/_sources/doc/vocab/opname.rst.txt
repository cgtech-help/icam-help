The OPNAME Command :kbd:`[MLEPC]`
=================================

The OPNAME command is used to identify the name of the upcoming
operation. This command is valid for all machine types. The format of
the command is as follows:

   :math:`\textbf{OPNAME / } \mathtt{'}\mathit{string}\,\mathtt{'} \;
   \,\icamrange{0.8}{0}\, \big[,\mathit{value}\,\big]`

The character string specifies the name of the operation. The
optional values can be formatted into the string using the format
specifications described in :ref:`“String Formatting”<string_formatting>`.
String formatting can be disabled if desired using the PPFUN/17 command described in
:ref:`“PPFUN 17: String Formatting”<string_formatting_ppfun>`.

The operation name will appear in diagnostic messages. It will also
appear in the Full Interface window status bar and in the Progress
window. When using HTML output, the operation name will appear in the
Navigator window as a link to the start of the operation.

The VTLAXS Command :kbd:`[M]`
=============================

The VTLAXS command defines angular tolerances that can be used by the
post-processor to eliminate or reduce rotary motions that have an
insignificant effect on the tool-to-part orientation.
The following VTLAXS command functions are available:

-  :ref:`“Rotary Axis Tolerance”<vtlaxs_angle>`
-  :ref:`“Tool Vector Tolerance”<vtlaxs_tlvec>`

.. _vtlaxs_angle:

Rotary Axis Tolerance
---------------------

Large rotations and oscillations of a rotary axis can occur as that
rotary axis approaches a “singular” orientation. This happens when
the tool axis is parallel or is nearly parallel to the axis of
rotation of a rotary axis. These rotations, although large, have very
little effect on the tool-to-part orientation. The following command
defines an angular tolerance to help eliminate unnecessary rotation:

   :math:`\textbf{VTLAXS / ANGLE},
   \begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{l} \mathit{toler} \\ \textbf{ON} \\ \textbf{OFF} \end{array}\end{pmatrix}`

The *toler* value specifies the angular tolerance in degrees,
measured as a conical half angle from each rotary axis of revolution.
When the tool axis falls within this cone, it will be adjusted (i.e.,
snapped) parallel to the rotary axis of revolution and the
corresponding rotary axis will be marked as singular and no longer
rotated. The choice of appropriate tolerance is a function of the CAM
system vector word size (in the CL file) and manufacturing
tolerances. For example, if *ijk* vector data is output to 4 decimal
places in the CL file, then a tolerance of 0.006 degrees (i.e., arc
tangent of 0.0001) is necessary to ignore round-off errors that may
affect the rotary axis position. Generally the error is not due to
the *ijk* word size, but is instead due to internal manufacturing
tolerances used by the CAM system. In this case the tolerance may
have to be set experimentally to produce the least amount of
unnecessary singular rotation while still respecting part angular
tolerances. The accumulated travel summary at the end of the GENER
listing can give an indication of the effectiveness of various
tolerance settings.

OFF inhibits the angular tolerance feature. ON re-enables the last
specified tolerance.

.. _vtlaxs_tlvec:

Tool Vector Tolerance
---------------------

Very small changes in tool axis vector can cause unwanted movement of
the rotary axes. The following command defines a vectorial tolerance
to help eliminate unnecessary rotation caused by slight changes in
tool vector orientation:

   :math:`\textbf{VTLAXS / TLVEC},
   \begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{l} \mathit{toler} \\ \textbf{ON} \\ \textbf{OFF} \end{array}\end{pmatrix}`

The *toler* value specifies a vectorial tolerance in degrees. When
this tolerance is active, the rotary axes will not move provided that
the compounded change in tool axis orientation is smaller than the
specified vectorial tolerance value.

OFF inhibits the vectorial tolerance feature. ON re-enables the last
specified tolerance.

The SYNCTR Command :kbd:`[L]`
=============================

The SYNCTR command is used to add synchronization points between channels in a program. In a merging lathe or a multi-channel machine, synchronization points allow you to control the scheduling of different portions of the program. When a synchronization point is reached, the program in the current channel pauses and waits until the other specified channels reach the same synchronization point.

The syntax of the command is as follows:

   :math:`\textbf{SYNCTR / NEXT} \; \Big[ ,\mathit{marker} \,\big[,\mathit{channel_1}, \dots \big] \Big]`

The first integer argument specifies the synchronization **marker**. The program in a channel stops only if the other specified channels have not yet reached this marker. If the marker is omitted, it is automatically generated by incrementing the previous marker.

Subsequent arguments specify the **channels** to be synchronized. This feature is particularly useful in environments with three or more channels. For example, two channels can be synchronized while a third channel continues running independently. If no channels are specified, SYNCTR assumes that all channels are to be synchronized.

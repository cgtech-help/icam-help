.. _command_delay:

The DELAY Command :kbd:`[MLEPC]`
================================

The DELAY command is used to establish a tool dwell or a machine halt
for a given amount of time, typically using a G04 code. This command
is valid for all machine types but some functions may not be
available on specific machines.

   :math:`\textbf{DELAY / } \big[ \,\textbf{DWELL}, \big] \mathit{seconds}`

   :math:`\textbf{DELAY / REV} ,\mathit{revolutions}`

There are two methods of controlling the length of the delay. The
first method is to specify the number of seconds for which the
machine should stop all movement. The second method is to specify the
actual number of revolutions of the spindle during which the machine
should not move. If neither DWELL or REV is specified, the delay
value is assumed to be seconds.

GENER will convert a delay in seconds to one in revolutions, or vice
versa, if only one delay method is available on the machine.
Depending on post-processor preferences, GENER may convert between
delay methods to avoid changing the feed-rate mode setting at the
control.

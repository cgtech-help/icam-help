The AIR Command :kbd:`[MLPC]`
=============================

The AIR command is used to control the supply of air to a device on
the machine. It could be used to control a chip vacuum or spindle
exhaust. This command is valid for all machine types but may not be
available on a specific machine.

   :math:`\textbf{AIR /} \begin{pmatrix} \begin{array}{l} \textbf{ON} \\ \textbf{OFF} \end{array} \end{pmatrix}`

   :math:`\textbf{AIR / ON} ,\mathit{seconds}`

There are two methods of controlling the air device. The first method
is used to turn the device on or off at different points in the
machining operation. This is done by coding AIR/ON to start the
device and AIR/OFF to stop the device. This is only valid if the air
device is modal, meaning that the device will not shut off
automatically, it must be instructed to do so.

The second method of controlling the air device is used to activate
the device for a specific length of time and then shut it off. This
is done by coding AIR/ON,\ *seconds*, where *seconds* is the amount
of time the device is to remain active. The AIR/OFF command is not
required as the device is automatically shut off after the time
period has expired.

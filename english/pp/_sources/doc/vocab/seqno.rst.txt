The SEQNO Command :kbd:`[MLEPC]`
================================

The SEQNO command is used to number the command blocks in the
tape file. This is typically an N register followed by an
integer value that steadily increases throughout the program. This
command is valid for all machine types but may not be available on
specific machines.

   :math:`\textbf{SEQNO /} \begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{l} \textbf{ON} \\ \textbf{OFF} \end{array}\end{pmatrix}`

   :math:`\textbf{SEQNO / AUTO}`

   :math:`\textbf{SEQNO / } \big[\,\textbf{CONST},\big] \; \mathit{value}`

   :math:`\textbf{SEQNO / } \big[\,\mathit{start},\big] \; \textbf{INCR},\mathit{increment} \; \big[,\mathit{count}\,\big]`

The first format, ON/OFF, can be used to start and stop the
outputting of sequence numbers on subsequent blocks of tape. Coding
SEQNO/ON will resume sequence numbering. Coding SEQNO/ OFF will
disable sequence numbering. A SEQNO/ON command is not necessary at
the start of the program as GENER will default to what is best for
the machine. A SEQNO/OFF command will be ignored if the machine
requires a sequence number on every block.

The SEQNO/AUTO command causes the following command blocks to be
numbered using the cutter location (CL) record number belonging to
the record that created the block. If multiple tape blocks are
generated as a result of a single CL record, then the same sequence
number will be repeated.

The SEQNO/CONST,\ *value* command will set the sequence number of one
or more tape blocks to the indicated value. If the CONST minor word
is coded, then all subsequent blocks will be numbered the same until
another SEQNO command is coded. If the CONST minor word is omitted,
then only the next block will have the specified sequence number,
thereafter regular sequence numbering will resume.

The last format provides a means of specifying a starting sequence
value, the amount by which to increment the sequence register each
time it is output and a value requesting output of sequence numbers
every *count* blocks. If the starting value is omitted, the next
sequence number will be the last one output plus the specified
increment. If the count value is omitted, then the last specified (or
default) count value will be used. Normally sequence numbers are
output on every block. *count* values greater than 1 will be ignored
if the machine requires a sequence number on every block.

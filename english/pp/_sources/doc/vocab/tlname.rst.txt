.. _command_tlname:

The TLNAME Command :kbd:`[ML]`
==============================

The TLNAME command is used to identify the name of the next tool to
be loaded. This command is valid for all machine types. The format of
the command is as follows:

   :math:`\textbf{TLNAME / } \mathtt{'}\mathit{string}\,\mathtt{'} \;
   \,\icamrange{0.8}{0}\, \big[,\mathit{value}\,\big]`

The character string specifies the name of the tool. The optional
values can be formatted into the string using the format
specifications described in :ref:`“String Formatting”<string_formatting>`.
String formatting can be disabled if desired using the PPFUN/17 command
described in :ref:`“PPFUN 17: String Formatting”<string_formatting_ppfun>`.

The tool name will appear in diagnostic messages. It will also appear
in the Full Interface window status bar and in the Progress window.
When using HTML output, the tool name will appear in the Navigator
window (appended to the tool number) as a link to the tool change
operation.

The tool name can also be specified using the TLNAME parameter on the
TOOLNO command.

The UNLOAD Command :kbd:`[MLE]`
===============================

The UNLOAD command is used to cut the wire on a wire EDM and to
unload tools and heads on mills and lathes.

Wire EDM machines:
------------------

   :math:`\textbf{UNLOAD /} \begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{l} \textbf{WIRE} \\ \textbf{TOOL} \end{array}\end{pmatrix}`

Causes the wire to be cut. The choice of TOOL or WIRE keyword is not important.

The wire can also be cut by loading wire zero. The following are equivalent:

   .. code-block::

      UNLOAD/WIRE
      LOAD/WIRE,0

Mill and Lathe machines:
------------------------

   :math:`\textbf{UNLOAD /} \begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{l} \textbf{TOOL} \\ \textbf{HEAD} \end{array}\end{pmatrix}`

Causes the current tool or head to be unloaded. Depending on the
machine, unloading a tool or head may leave the device empty, or may
result in a plug being loaded.

Other tool or head options can be specified following the TOOL or
HEAD keywords. See :ref:`the TOOLNO command<command_toolno>` for a complete list of allowable
options. Any such options specified are stored in an internal tooling
table for the current tool/head being unloaded and will be used on
subsequent related tooling commands. Tool and head options are modal
and need only be specified once, ideally on a TOOLNO command.

A tool (or head) can also be unloaded by loading tool (or head) zero.
The following are equivalent:

   .. code-block::

      UNLOAD/TOOL
      LOAD/TOOL,0

      UNLOAD/HEAD
      LOAD/HEAD,0

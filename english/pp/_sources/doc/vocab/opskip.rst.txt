.. _command_opskip:

The OPSKIP Command :kbd:`[MLEPC]`
=================================

The OPSKIP command is used to provide a means by which certain blocks
of data may be ignored or skipped over by the control. This command
is valid for all machine types but may not be available on a specific
machine.

   :math:`\textbf{OPSKIP /} \begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{l} \textbf{ON} \\ \textbf{OFF} \end{array}\end{pmatrix}
   \,\icamrange{0.8}{0}\, \big[,\mathit{level}\,\big]`

If the block DELETE selector switch on the control panel is in the
DELETE position, a special symbol, inserted at the beginning of
certain command blocks, causes those blocks to be skipped over by the
control. The insertion of this special symbol can be controlled by
the programmer. The OPSKIP/ON command will cause all subsequent
command blocks to be preceded by this symbol until an OPSKIP/OFF
command is programmed.

The *level* parameter may only be specified if the machine supports
multiple levels as specified in the OPSKIP section of QUEST. Up to
nine levels of OPSKIP may be output on a line at a given time,
depending on controller limitations.

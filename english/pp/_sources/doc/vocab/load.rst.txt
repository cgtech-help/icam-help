The LOAD Command :kbd:`[MLEP]`
==============================

The LOAD command is used to: thread and cut the wire on a wire EDM;
to select the active punch tools for punch presses; and to load and
unload tools and heads on mills and lathes.

Wire EDM machines:
------------------

   :math:`\textbf{LOAD /} \begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{l} \textbf{WIRE} \\ \textbf{TOOL} \end{array}\end{pmatrix} ,\mathit{tool\_id}`

Specify a positive non-zero *tool_id* to cause the wire to be
threaded at the current position; specify a zero (0) tool id to cause
the wire to be cut (or use the UNLOAD/WIRE command). The choice of
TOOL or WIRE keyword is not important.

Punch Press machines:
---------------------

   :math:`\textbf{LOAD / TOOL},\mathit{tool\_id}`

Specify a positive non-zero *tool_id* to cause the punch tool to be
changed.

Mill and Lathe machines:
------------------------

   :math:`\textbf{LOAD / }
   \big[\,\textbf{TOOL}, \mathtt{<\!tool\_information\!>}\,\big] \;
   \big[,\textbf{HEAD}, \mathtt{<\!head\_information\!>}\,\big]`

See :ref:`the TOOLNO command<command_toolno>` for a description of the tool and head information parameters.

If the *tool_id* on the LOAD/TOOL command matches the tool currently
loaded, then a redundant tool change operation will be generated. The
same is true if the head id on the LOAD/HEAD command matches the head
currently loaded.

On machines that support it, a value of zero (0) can be specified for
the tool or head id to unload the tool or head. This provides the
same functionality as the UNLOAD command.

The LOAD command is one of a group of commands used for the
management of tools. The TOOLNO command can optionally be used to
define the tool and head properties, so that only the *tool_id* or
*head_id* need later be specified with the other commands in the
group. The TOOLNO command performs no machine related actions; it is
used to preset the internal GENER tooling tables for those tools
specified. The SELECT and SELCTL commands are used to pre-select a
tool or head ready for use, but to not actually load it. The LOAD,
LOADTL and TURRET commands performs the action of loading the tool or
head. The UNLOAD command removes the current tool from the spindle or
head from the machine.

For example:

   .. code-block::

      TOOLNO/1,LENGTH,5.25,OSETNO,11
      TOOLNO/2,LENGTH,4.50,OSETNO,12
      TOOLNO/3,LENGTH,8.00,OSETNO,13,MANUAL
      $$
      SELECT/TOOL,1    $$ Select tool 1
      LOAD/TOOL,1      $$ Load tool 1
      SELCTL/TOOL,2    $$ Get tool 2 ready
      $$
      Motion commands for tool number 1
      $$
      LOAD/TOOL,2      $$ Load tool 2
      SELECT/TOOL,3    $$ Get tool 3 ready
      $$
      Motion commands for tool number 2
      $$
      LOAD/TOOL,3      $$ Load last tool (3)
      SELECT/TOOL,0    $$ Get the dummy tool ready
      $$
      Motion commands for tool number 3
      $$
      UNLOAD/TOOL      $$ Remove tool 3
      END

In the above example, the TOOLNO commands specify the length of the
tools, their length compensation offset numbers and for the third
tool, the fact that it must be loaded by hand. Thereafter, the
SELECT, LOAD and UNLOAD commands need only specify the tool number.

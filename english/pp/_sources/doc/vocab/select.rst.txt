The SELECT Command :kbd:`[MLP]`
===============================

The SELECT command is used to control the preselection of tools and
heads loaded by an automatic tool or head changer. This command is
only valid for machines that require preselection of tooling.

   :math:`\textbf{SELECT / TOOL}, \mathit{tool\_id} \; \big[,\mathtt{<\!tool\_information\!>}\,\big]`

   :math:`\textbf{SELECT / HEAD}, \mathit{head\_id} \; \big[,\mathtt{<\!head\_information\!>}\,\big]`

Specify a positive, non-zero, *tool_id* or *head_id* of the tool or
head to be preselected (i.e., made
ready for loading). Specify a value of zero (0) to preselect the
dummy tool or dummy head.

Other tool or head options can be specified following the *tool_id*
and *head_id* parameters. See :ref:`the TOOLNO command<command_toolno>`
for a complete list of allowable tool and head options. Any such options
specified are stored in an internal tooling table and will be used on
subsequent load and unload commands. Tool and head options are modal and
need only be specified once, ideally on a TOOLNO command.

The SELECT command itself is normally optional. GENER has the
capability to scan ahead in the CL file and preselect tools
immediately before they are required and/or immediately following the
previous LOAD/TOOL command. The ability to automatically preselect
tools is controlled in QUEST.

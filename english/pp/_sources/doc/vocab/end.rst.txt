The END Command :kbd:`[MLEPC]`
==============================

The END command is used to signal the machine that it has reached the
end of the program, typically using an M02 code. This command is
valid for all machine types and will always be available.

   :math:`\textbf{END}`

The END command is programmed without parameters. For some machines,
GENER will shut off the spindle and/or the coolant device if so
requested in QUEST. On some machines this function is automatic.

GENER treats the END command just like a STOP or OPSTOP command. It
cannot be used to break up a tape into smaller segments or reels. If
a tape break is desired, the BREAK command must be coded to perform
one.

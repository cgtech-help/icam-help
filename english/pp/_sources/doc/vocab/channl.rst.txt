The CHANNL Command :kbd:`[L]`
=============================

The CHANNL command is used to control the selection of channels on
a 4-axis merging lathe or on a multi-channel mill-turn machine.
The syntax of the command is as follows:

   :math:`\textbf{CHANNL /} \begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{l} \textbf{ON} \\ \textbf{OFF} \\ \mathit{channel\_id} \,\end{array}\end{pmatrix}`

The ON and OFF options are used to control the activation of the merging mode.
While in merge mode, two or more turrets or machining heads move together.
The CHANNL/ON command must be immediately followed by a CHANNL command identifying a channel number.
All commands following a CHANNL command with a channel number are associated to the specified channel.
Commands given after the CHANNL/OFF command are processed in non-merging mode and are associated to the main channel.

The following is a valid sequence of commands used in the merge mode:

   .. code-block:: text

      CHANNL/ON
      CHANNL/1
      GOTO/...
      CHANNL/2
      GOTO/...
      CHANNL/3
      GOTO/...
      CHANNL/OFF

The PARTNO Command :kbd:`[MLEPC]`
=================================

The PARTNO command is used to provide part program identification.
This command is valid for all machine types.

   :math:`\textbf{PARTNO / } \, \mathtt{'}\mathit{string}\,\mathtt{'}`

The PARTNO command specifies a textual identification of the NC
program. The identification text is printed on the verification
listing at the top of each page. It can also appear in man readable
characters in the leader and/or trailer sections of the NC control
tape file. Man readable tape output is an optional feature controlled
by QUEST in the “Output Format” topic under the “General Description”
section.

If a PARTNO command is not found within the first 20 records of a CL
file, then the identification text will default to “Undefined
PARTNO”. The default limit of 20 can be changed in the configuration
file.

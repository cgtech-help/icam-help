The MSYS Command :kbd:`[MLEPC]`
===============================

The MSYS command is used to specify a machine coordinate frame for
subsequent CL data. The MSYS command is informational, unless a form
of automatic LCS is enabled based on the MSYS command definition.
This command is valid for all machines.

   :math:`\textbf{MSYS / } \big[ \,\textbf{LAST}, \big] \,\mathtt{<\!matrix\!>}`

Two separate coordinate frames can be defined. MSYS defines the
primary coordinate frame and MSYS/LAST defines a second coordinate
frame.

The <matrix> typically defines the location and orientation of the
machine coordinate frame with respect to the part coordinate system.
The matrix can be specified using the standard post-processor
transformation syntax (see :ref:`“The ORIGIN Command”<command_origin>`).

A coordinate frame defined by MSYS can be subsequently referenced by
any of the post-processor commands that support a transformation
capability. These include LCS, LIMIT, PLOT and ORIGIN. With the
exception of the LCS/AUTO command (see :ref:`here<command_lcs>`), the MSYS frame definition is informational.
The updated frame definition only takes effect when one of these
other transformation commands is next coded. For example:

   .. code-block::

      MSYS/*matrix1*
      GOTO/…            $$ no frame in effect
      LCS/MSYS
      GOTO/…            $$ *matrix1* in effect
      MSYS/*matrix2*
      GOTO/…            $$ *matrix1* still in effect
      LCS/MSYS
      GOTO/…            $$ *matrix2* in effect

When LCS/AUTO,3 or LCS/AUTO,4 is active, the MSYS command defines the
new local coordinate system, which is applied immediately. For
example:

   .. code-block::

      MSYS/*matrix1*
      GOTO/…            $$ no frame in effect
      LCS/AUTO,3
      GOTO/…            $$ *matrix1* in effect
      MSYS/*matrix2*
      GOTO/…            $$ *matrix2* in effect

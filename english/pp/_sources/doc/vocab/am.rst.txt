The AM Command :kbd:`[MLC]`
===========================

The AM command is used to control an additive or hybrid manufacturing
device on the machine, which is available as a **separately licensed
option** of GENER. This command is valid for milling, turning and
contouring machine types but may not be available on a specific
machine.

   :math:`\textbf{AM /} \begin{pmatrix} \begin{array}{l} \textbf{ON} \\ \textbf{OFF} \end{array} \end{pmatrix}`

   :math:`\textbf{AM / } \big[ \textbf{ POWER}, \big] \, value`

The AM/ON command enables material deposition at the current or
machine default power setting. Material deposition then remains
active until disabled by an AM/OFF command.

For those machines that support it, the deposition power can modally
be controlled by specifying the required power value, optionally
preceded by a POWER keyword.

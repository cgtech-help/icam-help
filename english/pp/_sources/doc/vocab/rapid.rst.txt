The RAPID Command :kbd:`[MLEPC]`
================================

The RAPID command is used for “punch off” positioning moves for punch
presses and high speed positioning for other types of machines. This
command is valid for all machine types.

   :math:`\textbf{RAPID}`

The RAPID command must be coded with no parameters. It can be modal
or one-shot (non-modal). The QUEST verification file should be
checked to see which method is used for a particular machine. When
modal is selected, RAPID is disabled when a FEDRAT command is
encountered. If non-modal is selected, only the next motion is
performed at rapid: Feed rate mode is immediately reinstated
following the rapid motion.

For punch presses this command will cause the next motion (or
motions) to be a positioning move with punching and nibbling turned
off.

For other machine types the RAPID command will cause the next motion
(or motions) to be executed by the machine in the high speed
positioning mode. RAPID motions are processed at the highest linear
interpolation rate available on machines not having separate
positioning and interpolation modes.

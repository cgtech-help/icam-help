The REWIND Command :kbd:`[MLEPC]`
=================================

The REWIND command is used to signal the machine that it has reached
the end of the program and that it must rewind the tape to the rewind
stop code, typically using an M30 code. This command is valid for all
machine types.

   :math:`\textbf{REWIND } \Big[ \textbf{ / } \mathit{number} \;\Big]`

To conform to APT standard, the REWIND command requires at least one
parameter. This parameter can be any number that you may want to use
as it will be ignored by GENER.

GENER may shut off the spindle and/or the coolant device if requested
to do so in QUEST. On some machines this function is automatic.

A REWIND command is treated just like a STOP or END command. It
cannot be used to break up a tape into smaller segments or reels. If
a tape break is desired, a BREAK command must be coded.

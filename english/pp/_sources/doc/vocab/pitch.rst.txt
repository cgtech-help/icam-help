The PITCH Command :kbd:`[L]`
============================

The PITCH command is used to specify the number of threads per CL
unit for the next (and subsequent) COUPLE and THREAD commands. This
command is only valid for lathes with threading capabilities. The
syntax is as follows:

   :math:`\textbf{PITCH /}
   \begin{bmatrix}\,\begin{array}{l} \textbf{IPR} \\ \textbf{MMPR} \\ \textbf{PERREV} \\ \textbf{TPI} \end{array} \;, \end{bmatrix}
   \,\mathit{pitch} \;
   \big[,\textbf{MULTRD},\mathit{starts}\,\big]
   \begin{bmatrix} , \begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{l} \textbf{INCR} \\ \textbf{DECR} \end{array}\end{pmatrix} ,\mathit{value}\, \end{bmatrix}`

If unqualified by a feed modifier, *pitch* is the number of threads
per CL unit. If the CL units are inches then a *pitch* of 10
indicates 10 threads per inch. The pitch can also be specified as a
distance per revolution, or as the number of threads per inch (TPI).

The MULTRD option specifies multiple start threading. The default, if
not specified, is 1. The number of starts is coded immediately
following the MULTRD keyword. The *starts* value must be a non-zero,
positive integer.

PITCH must be coded before using the COUPLE or THREAD commands. Once
coded, the specified pitch and number of starts will be used for all
threading operations until a new PITCH command is specified.

The INCR and DECR *value* option is used to indicate a variable lead
thread. It specifies the change of the lead for each spindle
revolution. For example, if the pitch at the start is **0.125** and
the last pitch is **0.100**, the resulting value would be **0.025**
(assuming the change in pitch is for 1 revolution). Omit INCR or
DECR, or specify a value of zero to indicate a constant lead thread.

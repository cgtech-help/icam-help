The OPSTOP Command :kbd:`[MLEPC]`
=================================

The OPSTOP command is used to conditionally stop all machine movement
when coded in the part program, typically using an M01 code. This
command is valid for all machine types but may not be available on
specific machines.

   :math:`\textbf{OPSTOP}`

Some machines allow an optional or conditional stop. If the machine
tool operator sets the “OPTIONAL-STOP” toggle switch on the control
panel, the machine will stop when an OPSTOP code is encountered on
the tape. It will ignore OPSTOP codes if the switch is not set.

For punches, if the OPSTOP code turns punching off, GENER may
optionally turn it back on when the machine is restarted. For other
types of machines GENER might also output codes to stop the spindle
and/or the coolant flow if this is not done automatically by the
control. This action will be determined by the responses to QUEST.
Codes might also be output to restart the spindle and/or the coolant
flow following the OPSTOP (M) code.

If the OPSTOP command is not available for a specific machine, GENER
can output a STOP code if it has been requested in QUEST.

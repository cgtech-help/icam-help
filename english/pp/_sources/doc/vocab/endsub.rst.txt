The ENDSUB Command :kbd:`[MLEPC]`
=================================

The ENDSUB command is used to identify the end of a predefined
subprogram. A predefined subprogram consists of: a DEFSUB command
naming the subprogram; one or more part program instructions defining
the body of the subprogram; and a terminating ENDSUB command. A
subprogram is called by coding a CALSUB command with a matching
subprogram identifier. This command is valid for all machine types.

The PPRINT Command :kbd:`[MLEPC]`
=================================

The PPRINT command is used to output a message to the verification
listing or to the NC control tape. This command is valid for all
machine types. The format of the command is as follows:

   :math:`\textbf{PPRINT / } \mathtt{'}\mathit{string}\,\mathtt{'} \;
   \,\icamrange{0.8}{0}\, \big[,\mathit{value}\,\big]`

The character string will normally be written to the verification
listing. The optional values can be formatted into the string using
the format specifications described in :ref:`“String Formatting”<string_formatting>`.
String formatting can be disabled if desired using the PPFUN/17 command described in
:ref:`“PPFUN 17: String Formatting”<string_formatting_ppfun>`.

If DISPLY/ON has been coded then the character string will appear in
the NC control tape as an operator message if this functionality is
available. If TPRINT/ON has been coded then the character string will
appear in the NC control tape as a comment if this functionality is
available.

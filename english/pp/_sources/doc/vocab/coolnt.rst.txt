The COOLNT Command :kbd:`[MLE]`
===============================

The COOLNT command is used to control the coolant type on the
machine, typically using M07, M08 and M09 codes. This command is
valid for mills, lathes and EDMs, but some or all features may not be
available on a specific machine.
The following COOLNT command functions are available:

-  :ref:`“Primary Coolant”<coolant_primary>`
-  :ref:`“Coolant Pressure”<coolant_pressure>`
-  :ref:`“Auxiliary Coolant”<coolant_auxiliary>`

.. _coolant_primary:

Primary Coolant
---------------

   :math:`\textbf{COOLNT /} \begin{pmatrix} \begin{array}{l} \textbf{ON} \\ \textbf{FLOOD} \\ \textbf{MIST} \\ \textbf{TAPKUL} \\ \textbf{THRU} \\ \mathit{custom\_type} \,\end{array}\end{pmatrix}
   \big[ ,\textbf{NOW} \,\big]`

   :math:`\textbf{COOLNT / OFF } \big[ ,\textbf{ALL} \,\big]`

This command activates or deactivates primary coolant for the
machine. ON starts dielectric fluid for EDMs and restarts primary
coolant for other machine types. If COOLNT/ON is coded at the start
of a program before a specific type is established, the QUEST
specified default type will be used. OFF stops dielectric fluid for
EDMs and stops the primary coolant for other machine types. The
OFF,ALL keyword combination stops all active primary and auxiliary
coolant types.

The remaining options are valid for mills and lathes, but not EDMs.

FLOOD coolant is generally used when removing large amounts of
material. MIST coolant is used for finishing operations. TAPKUL is
used to specify a special oil compound for threading and tapping.
THRU coolant is generally used with tools that pipe the coolant at
high pressure through the tool. The post-processor may support other
QUEST defined custom coolant types. Custom types are identified by a
single keyword or a keyword pair.

NOW forces the activation code out immediately, overriding any QUEST
specified default action of the post-processor that might delay the
coolant activation to the next feed or plunge motion. Delayed
application of coolant is only available for the primary coolant; it
is not available for auxiliary coolant or coolant pressure settings.

.. _coolant_pressure:

Coolant Pressure
----------------

   :math:`\textbf{COOLNT / PRSSUR}, \begin{pmatrix} \begin{array}{l} \textbf{ON} \\ \textbf{OFF} \\ \\ \textbf{HIGH} \\ \textbf{LOW} \\ \\ \begin{bmatrix}\,\begin{array}{l} \textbf{BAR} \\ \textbf{PA} \\ \textbf{PSI} \\ \textbf{TORR} \end{array} \, , \, \end{bmatrix} \mathit{value} \end{array} \end{pmatrix}`

This command, available for mills and lathes, sets the coolant
pressure at the machine if available. The ON and OFF keywords
activate or deactivate the high pressure coolant pump.

HIGH and LOW output the maximum and minimum supported pressure codes.
A pressure *value* can be specified in bars, Pascals, pounds per
square inch or torrs. The pressure unit keyword can be specified
after the *value* if desired. If omitted, the QUEST defined pressure
units are assumed. The PRSSUR keyword can be omitted except when
specifying ON or OFF.

.. _coolant_auxiliary:

Auxiliary Coolant
-----------------

   :math:`\textbf{COOLNT / } \mathit{custom\_type} \begin{bmatrix} ,\! \begin{array}{l} \textbf{ON} \\ \textbf{OFF} \end{array} \, \end{bmatrix}`

This command, available for mills and lathes, activates and
deactivates auxiliary coolant devices on the machine. Auxiliary
coolant devices are those that can be activated independent of the
primary coolant (e.g., coolant on a steady-rest). Auxiliary coolant
devices, if available, are unique to each post-processor. They are
identified by a single keyword or a keyword pair. ON activates the
auxiliary coolant (the default). OFF deactivates the auxiliary
coolant.

Primary coolant, auxiliary coolant and coolant pressure settings can
all be combined on the same post-processor command. For example:

   .. code-block:: text

      COOLNT/FLOOD,STDYRS,PRSSUR,HIGH

..

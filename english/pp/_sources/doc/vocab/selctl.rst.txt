The SELCTL Command :kbd:`[MLP]`
===============================

The SELCTL command is a non-standard\ [#]_ alias for the
SELECT/TOOL and SELECT/HEAD commands. It is used to control the
preselection of tools and heads loaded by an automatic tool or head
changer. This command is only valid for machines that require
preselection of tooling.

   :math:`\textbf{SELCTL / } \mathit{tool\_id} \; \big[,\mathtt{<\!tool\_information\!>}\,\big]`

   :math:`\textbf{SELCTL / HEAD}, \mathit{head\_id} \; \big[,\mathtt{<\!head\_information\!>}\,\big]`

See :ref:`the TOOLNO command<command_toolno>` for a description of the tool and head information
parameters. See :ref:`the SELECT command<command_select>` for more details on the preselection of
tools and heads.

.. [#] International Standards Organization ISO 4343:1972 defined SELCTL
   as a standard post-processor command, but this was later revised to
   SELECT/TOOL in the ISO 4343:2000 update.

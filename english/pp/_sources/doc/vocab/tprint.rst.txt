The TPRINT Command :kbd:`[MLEPC]`
=================================

The TPRINT command is used to output a comment to the NC control tape
(MCD). This command is valid for all machine types. The format of the
command is as follows:

   :math:`\textbf{TPRINT / }
   \big[\,\textbf{NEXT},\big] \;
   \mathtt{'}\mathit{string}\,\mathtt{'} \;
   \,\icamrange{0.8}{0}\, \big[,\mathit{value}\,\big]`

   :math:`\textbf{TPRINT /} \begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{l} \textbf{ON} \\ \textbf{OFF} \end{array}\end{pmatrix}`

There are two methods of outputting comments to the MCD.

The first method allows you to enter the character string with
optional parameter values formatted into the string using the format
specifications described in :ref:`“String Formatting”<string_formatting>`.
String formatting can be disabled if desired using the PPFUN/17 command
described in :ref:`PPFUN 17: String Formatting<string_formatting_ppfun>`. The text
will be output by GENER to the MCD. If NEXT is specified and comments
can be intermixed with other data on a block of MCD, then the comment
will be appended to the next MCD block output. Otherwise, the comment
will appear on a block alone.

The second method uses the parameters ON and OFF together with
upcoming PPRINT commands. When TPRINT/ON is coded in the CL file, all
subsequent PPRINT commands will be interpreted as TPRINT commands,
causing PPRINT messages be output as comments in the MCD. This
redirection will continue until a TPRINT/OFF command is encountered.
PPRINT commands will then be treated as regular PPRINT commands and
be output in the verification listing.

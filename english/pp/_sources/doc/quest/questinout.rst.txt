QUEST Inputs and Outputs
========================

This section describes the various files that can be imported
(input), maintained and exported (output) by QUEST.

The ICAM Database
-----------------

The database contains information about each post-processor that has
been defined using QUEST. The database also contains information
about control emulator and Virtual Machine models. The default
database is named *campost.dbf* and can be found in the *work*
subdirectory of the *icam_appdata* directory
(see :ref:`“Configuration Storage and Application Data”<configuration_storage>`).
This default can be changed by creating an environment variable named *icam_dbf*
that defines the path and filename of a different database. The database
is in an ICAM proprietary format. Each database (there can
be more than one) can hold many post-processors. Each post-processor
in the database can in turn have many revisions, since by default
QUEST keeps all changed copies of a post-processor.

Inside the database, post-processors that have been deemed ready for
production are “generated”. Generated post-processor are those that have been
checked for inconsistencies while being saved by QUEST. This is
indicated by a gold colored icon beside the post-processor name when
viewed in the Database Navigator in QUEST. Only generated
post-processors can be used with
GENER to produce
CNC programs (except for testing, but more on that later).

See :ref:`“Database Upgrade Procedure”<database_upgrade>` for step-by-step details on
upgrading the post-processor database to V26.

Exported/Imported Post-Processor
--------------------------------------

Individual post-processors can be **exported** from (copied out of)
the database. This is done using QUEST. An exported post-processor is
an exact replica of the information stored in the database, stored in
its original binary format. The default file name for an exported
post-processor is the name of the post-processor itself, with a file
type of *dmp* (e.g., |file|\_1.dmp for a post-processor named |File|\,1).

Exported post-processors can be **imported** (read) into another
database using the Import button on the GENER launch panel, or by
dragging and dropping the exported post-processor file onto a running
portal application or the portal desktop icon, or via the QUEST
Database»Import menu-bar selection.

QUEST 2000/13.0 and earlier versions provided a “transfer file” or
“trn” file export/import feature, which was used to copy
post-processors from one system type to another. This is no longer
necessary since both databases and exported post-processors are now
cross-platform compatible.
Use the *dmp* file format when
transferring post-processors between databases or when e-mailing them to ICAM
technical support.

Dedicated Post-Processors
-------------------------------

Dedicated post-processors are ready-made to user specifications and
are delivered by ICAM or one of our representatives. Dedicated
post-processors are restricted for operation on specifically licensed
systems. Dedicated post-processors have a file extension of *dp*
(e.g., |file|\_1.dp).

Dedicated post-processors are imported into the database using GENER or QUEST
in the same way as other exported post-processors. Once imported, the
dedicated post-processor is ready-to-run (i.e., does not have to be generated).

Dedicated post-processors have special restrictions not placed on
other post-processors. For example, they cannot be modified or
printed. Do not change the name of a dedicated post-processor since
the licensing system expects to find a post-processor with the
as-delivered name.

Basic Post-Processors
---------------------------

Basic post-processors change the default responses for questions (in
QUEST) to more accurately reflect a particular controller or machine.
Basic post-processors are supplied for both machines and controls
(they reside in the *basic* subdirectory where Icam Post is
installed). They can be easily selected when a new post-processor is
being created with QUEST.
One of the steps in the *New-Post Wizard*
is to select the basic post (from a list) that most closely matches
that of the CNC controller.
The machine and controller basic post-processors
can also be selected using questions 4.00 and 5.00 of the *General Information,
General Description* section.

The QUEST Listing
-----------------

Listings are created when the QUEST Print or Generate utilities are
run and whenever a macro is compiled. Two outputs formats are
supported: HTML and standard listing, controlled by the
*use_html_list* definition file symbol. Listing files use the same
name as the post-processor, with an appropriate file extension
(“.lis” or “.htm”) depending on the output format (e.g.,
|file|\_1.lis for a post-processor named |File|,1).

HTML Listing Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :width: 4.881in
   :align: right

With HTML format, the post-processor listing is contained within 3 files.

The main file (e.g., |file|\_1.htm) organizes the layout of the screen
using the <frameset> feature available on most browsers. This file includes
links to two other files:

One of these files contains the complete post-processor listing (e.g., |file|\_1_list.htm), which is also
suitable for viewing or printing on its own.

The other file (e.g., |file|\_1_nav.htm) acts like a table of contents,
providing a means of quickly navigating the post-processor listing.

By default, listing files are created with an extension of *htm* in
the same directory as the database that holds the post-processor. The
*icam_lis* environment variable (see :ref:`“Environment Variables<environment_variables>`)
can be set to define a different directory where QUEST will write post-processor
listing files. The *html_ext_list* DEF file symbol can be set to change the verification
listing file extension default (see :ref:`here<def_html_ext>`).

Macro compilation listings are always output in standard listing
format, described immediately below.

Standard Listing Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard listing format can use one of two carriage-control
forms: FCC and list. The choice is controlled by the *page_format*
definition file symbol. The FCC form, which stands for Fortran
Carriage Control, reserves the first character of each line for page
formatting purposes. QUEST will output: a 1 in this position to
advance to a new page; a 0 to double space an output line; and a
blank for regular single spacing. This file can be printed on any
printer or driver recognizing FCC output. The list form does not
reserve a character for carriage control. Instead, a form-feed
character is output at the start of a record to advance to a new
page. All other records are output one per line.

The page length is set in the definitions file using the
*lines_per_page* variable.

By default, listing files are created with an extension of *lis* in
the same directory as the database that holds the post-processor. The
*icam_lis* environment variable (see :ref:`“Environment Variables”<environment_variables>`)
can be set to define a different directory where QUEST will write post-processor listing files.
The *file_ext_list* DEF file symbol can be set to change the verification
listing file extension default (see :ref:`here<def_file_ext>`).

Using QUEST
===========

This section describes the QUEST interface and other details
necessary to effectively create and maintain post-processors.

The :ref:`image below<quest_windows_interface>` shows the various components of the
complete QUEST interface. This reference manual does not describe how
to interact with standard Windows components (such as toolbars,
list-boxes or push-buttons). Instead, this section will concentrate
on the purpose of each of the main windows (there are three:
navigator, working and information) and some of the key functions
available through the menu-bar and toolbar menus.

   QUEST Windows Interface

The QUEST Interface
-------------------

The QUEST interface consists of three main windows:

1) The left hand window is the **Navigator**, which is used to view the
list of post-processors in a database as well as to access the
different information components of a post-processor. Select the
“Database” tab at the bottom of the navigator window to see the list
(if any) of databases. Individual post-processors can be read into
QUEST from the database so they can be viewed or modified. Each
post-processor, once loaded, can be accessed by selecting one of the
named tabs at the bottom of the navigator window. The Help tab in the
Information window displays information about the entry selected in
the Navigator. Double-click on a section entry in the Navigator
window to make changes to that section.

2) The upper right window is the **Main** working window. This window
will change to show lists of questions, tables of results, dialog
panels, macro editors, et cetera, primarily as a result of selections
made in the Navigator. Most of your interaction with QUEST will occur
in the main window. You can press the F1 function key to obtain
context sensitive on-line help on how to use the main window.

3) The lower right window is the **Information** window. This window
holds various types of information, each of which can be accessed by
selecting one of the organizational tabs arranged along the bottom
edge of the window. Most of the time, QUEST will automatically select
the proper tab for you based on the last feature or action requested.
The tab names and their purpose are as follows:

-  The **Help** tab provides detailed help when the Main window focus is
   on a question, or when a section is selected in the Navigator window.

   \

-  The **Build** tab lists informational and diagnostic messages when
   they occur. You can often double-click on a diagnostic message to
   address the problem in the Main window.

   \

-  The **Consistency** tab lists inconsistencies found in the
   post-processor. Use the **Tools» Consistency** menu-bar selection
   (Ctrl Shift G shortcut) to run the consistency checks. Double click
   on a line in the Consistency tab to review or correct a listed
   inconsistency. This opens the appropriate section with the
   problematic item in focus. The F4 and Shift F4 keys can be used to
   move forwards and backwards through the list of inconsistencies. The
   following checks are performed:

   -  Differences in question responses as compared to the *General
      Description/General Information* question 4 “Machine defaults”
      selection. The expected response is shown on the line within
      parentheses; the actual response is shown at the end of the line.

   -  Differences in question responses as compared to the *General
      Description/General Information* question 5 “Control defaults”
      selection. The expected response is shown on the line within
      parentheses; the actual response is shown at the end of the line.

   -  Inconsistencies between question responses from different
      sections. This is shown in the same way as during a File»Generate,
      with the root question listed first and those with inconsistent
      responses listed with a slight indent below it.

   -  Out-of-date RMD actions. When an RMD action is added to a
      post-processor, the macro text associated with that action is
      added along with the action identifier. The RMD consistency check
      compares the macro text stored in the post-processor against the
      macro text of the RMD action and indicates an inconsistency if
      different. To update an RMD macro, delete the old action and replace it with a new
      one. Running Tools»Diffs (see below) between the original and updated
      post-processor will show the changes. Out-of-date RMD actions are
      also listed during a File»Generate.

   -  Code inconsistencies, which are the result of two or more functions
      sharing the same G or M code. These are also listed during a
      Generate.

.. _finder_tab:

-  The **Finder** tab lists the results of the last search operation.
   Use the **Tools»Finder** menu-bar selection (Ctrl Shift F shortcut)
   to find questions, tape editor definitions, dialogs and macros
   containing text matching a “search” string (press F1 to obtain help
   on search features). Double-click on any line listed in the Finder
   tab to change the Main window focus to the selected item. Use F4 and
   Shift F4 to sequentially shift the Finder tab focus (and indirectly
   the Main window focus) forwards and backwards through the list of
   items found.

.. _diffs_tab:

-  The **Diffs** tab lists the differences between two selected
   post-processors and/or control emulators. Use the **Tools»Diffs**
   menu-bar selection (Ctrl I shortcut) to identify the objects to
   compare (press F1 to obtain help on comparison features). You can
   double-click on any line with a solid arrow to change the Main
   window focus to the selected item. Various right-mouse context menu
   functions are also available in the Diffs tab to help view the
   comparison results.

   \

-  The **Axes** tab lists all machine axes and provides sliders that can
   be used to exercise the machine model. This feature is only available
   with a Virtual Machine Developer’s license (vmq260).

The **menu-bar** at the top of the application window provides access
to QUEST functions. Not all menu actions are available at all times.
For example, some database actions are only available when a database
or post-processor is selected in the navigator. Other menu actions
are related to the macro editor and will only be available when a
macro is being edited. Keyboard shortcuts are available for some
common menu actions (the shortcut key is listed in the menus to the
right of the menu selection).

The most common menu actions are also available through **toolbar**
shortcuts (the little icons arranged below the menu-bar). Toolbars
are dockable (i.e., they can be dragged to any side of the
application window, or even be made to appear as a separate window).
Like the menu-bar selections they represent, toolbar icons may not be
selectable at all times.

The right-mouse button can be used to bring up a **pop-up menu**
(context sensitive menu), listing the most common menu choices that
can be made in the current window or on the item last selected.
Pop-up menus also provide access to modal display and processing
options. This feature is highly recommended to those who are new to
QUEST, since it lists the most common actions based on the current
context.

The **vertical splitter bar** can be used to increase or decrease the
width of the Navigator window. The **horizontal splitter bar**
likewise determines how the main working window and informational
window share the full application window height. You can double-click
on the splitter bar to quickly reset it to its last position.

Creating a New Post-Processor
-----------------------------------

.. _quest_interface:

When QUEST is first run, the application window will appear as shown
below.

.. figure:: ../../media/quest_start.png
   :width: 5.681in
   :align: center

   QUEST as it looks when first run

You create a new post-processor using the **File»New Post**\ [#]_
drop down menu selection. Double-click on the “General Information”
line in the Navigator to begin editing your new post-processor. The
Main work window will then change to show a short list of questions,
with tabs arranged along the bottom. Your first action should be to
change the post-processor name (i.e., NONAME,1) to something more
appropriate.

QUEST supports two different question display styles. The “classic”
style is a top-down list of questions, organized one per line. This
is the format that is used in textual examples in this manual (as
shown in the text example below). A more modern “graphic” question
style uses typical windows controls such as radio-buttons,
checkboxes, drop-down lists, et cetera. This is the format that is
used in example images in this manual (as shown in the
:ref:`“A stopper question”<stopper_question>` image).
You can switch between styles at any time using the
**View\ »\ Graphic Questions** menu-bar toggle or the right-mouse
button **Graphic Questions** pop-up menu toggle. You can also enable
or disable the organization of questions by bottom tabs using the
right-mouse button **Use tab** pop-up menu toggle.

When creating a post-processor from scratch, the third question in
the list will be shown highlighted in red (a stopper question)
indicating that an answer must be provided before you can continue or
even exit the section.

   ::

      3.00 Machine type: [Contour,Edm,Punch,Lathe,Mill-Turn,Mill,Robot,Composite] (No Response)

All classic style questions have this same appearance. The square
brackets **[ ]** define the acceptable responses (answers) to the
question. The parentheses **( )** show the current response to the
question. Answers can be typed by first selecting the question using
the mouse or arrow keys, typing your response (abbreviations are
accepted) and then pressing the Enter key. You can also answer a
question using the mouse. When you move the mouse pointer over the
items in the brackets and parentheses, they will be highlighted in a
same way a browser does. You can click on a highlighted item to
change the response to the question. For example, to answer “Mill”
for question #3, you can move the mouse pointer over the word inside
the [ ] brackets and then click the left-mouse button.

Graphic style questions have a more varied appearance. Lists of
acceptable responses to a question are sometimes listed vertically in
a selection box and at other times in a drop-down list. Simple yes/no
questions often use a checkbox, where a checked response means
“yes”. Some questions show a list of acceptable responses in square
brackets [ ] as part of the question prompt. The interface is
designed, as much as possible, to show the list of possible responses
to each question, along with the current response. You change the
current (default) response to a question by using the mouse and
left-mouse button to point to and select another listed choice for
that question. For simple edit box type controls, such as the
post-processor name selection, you must select the edit box using the
mouse and then either type in a new response or edit the current
response. Many question types include a **[…]** button, which when
selected will activate a dialog box to assist you in changing the
response to the question.

The “Help” information window (bottom right of the application
window) will always describe the selected question in more detail.
The selected question is normally listed in blue. When using the
graphic question style, help information will be shown as a balloon
tooltip when you leave the mouse pointer over the input field of a
question. You can enable or disable help tooltips at any time using
the right-mouse button **Show Help Tips** pop-up menu toggle.

Red “stopper” questions are those that do not have a default
response. They must be answered before you can continue. In fact, all
questions following the stopper one will not be shown, nor can the
section be exited until a valid answer is given (the OK button will
not be selectable). If the questions are grouped under organizational
tabs, the tab containing the stopper question will be shown in red.
In the image below, question 3.00 is a stopper question.

.. _stopper_question:

.. figure:: ../../media/quest_stopper.png
   :width: 5.681in
   :align: center

   A “stopper” question

Questions are listed in green if they have a response that is
different from the default (i.e., those where you selected or typed
an answer different from what was shown in the ( ) parentheses). You
can reset a question back to its default state (provided it had a
default) using the right-mouse context menu. One of the menu choices
will be **Reset to “\ whatever\ ”**. You can reset every question in
the section back to its default by clicking on the Reset button at
the bottom of the window.

Depending on the right-mouse button **Auto Clear** pop-up menu
setting, questions and tabs might be shown in a light grey. If a
question is greyed out, it means that it is no longer applicable
based on some earlier response in the section. If an organizational
tab is greyed out, then all questions listed in that section are no
longer applicable, based on some response in another tabbed section
(generally to the left). To see this in action, uncheck the Auto
Clear option and then choose different responses to the machine type
question (#3). Questions that are appropriate for milling machines
will be greyed out when the machine type is changed to a lathe. Some
people prefer to see this effect when they are answering questions in
a section, others find it confusing. Greyed out questions are cleared
when a section is exited or the right-mouse button **Clear Now**
pop-up menu is selected.

All questions are numbered. You can choose to see or not see the
question numbers using the right-mouse **Show Question Numbers**
pop-up menu toggle. This setting affects the appearance of questions
in the work window, but has no effect on the Finder, Diffs and other
QUEST functions.

Questionnaire Defaults
----------------------

The easiest way to develop a post-processor is to base it on
a preexisting controller architecture. QUEST provides many “basic post” defaults
in support of popular and less well known controllers.
You specify the controller basic post
using question 5.00 in the General Information section:

   ::

      5.00 Control defaults: [NA,File_name,File_panel] (NA)

Click on File_panel and then choose an appropriate controller from
the list that will be presented. If a basic post is not selected,
then QUEST follows the ISO 6983 standard where possible.

Every question originally starts off in an unanswered state and most
unanswered questions have a default response. QUEST determines the
default response for a question in a number of ways.

-  *From the basic post:* Basic posts define default responses to just
   those questions that apply. For example, a control-type basic post
   won’t define default answers for machine specific features (e.g.,
   number of spindle gears).

-  *From the ISO 6983 standard:* Default responses for control related
   questions will follow this international standard where applicable.

-  *Derived from earlier answers:* QUEST will propose default responses
   that are consistent with earlier responses in the same section and
   sometimes from other sections higher up in the Navigator list.

All questions in a section are marked as answered when you press the
OK button to leave the section. All questions in every section are
marked as answered when you Generate the post-processor (i.e., save
it in a format ready to be used by GENER). All questions in a section
are reset to an unanswered state when you press the Reset button.
Individual questions can be reset using the “Reset to” pop-up context
menu. Answering a particular question in a section marks all lower
numbered questions in that section as answered. To take advantage of
QUEST’s capability to derive default responses, try to answer
questions in a section in order from lowest numbered to highest
numbered.

Changing your Control and Machine default choices will have no effect
on any question that has already been answered.

Questionnaire Chapters and Sections
-----------------------------------

The QUEST Navigator window will list a series of chapters and
sections that comprise the knowledge base for the current post-processor
see the Navigator contents in the :ref:`“QUEST Windows Interface”<quest_windows_interface>` image).
Each post-processor consists of a number of
chapters. Each chapter in turn consists of a number of sections. Most
(but not all) sections present a list of questions as described
earlier. Section icons in the navigator use different colors and
emphasis to show if the section has been answered or not and, in some
cases, if the feature is available on the machine/controller or not.
Double-click on a section name in the Navigator to view and/or change
the knowledge base for that section in the Main window (i.e., the
upper right working window). Single-click on a section name in the
Navigator to view the knowledge base for that section in the Help
window.

The following is a list of chapters and sections of the
questionnaire. Depending on the CNC type and its features, some of
these sections and chapters might not be listed (since they do not
apply).

-  The **General Description** chapter has sections that obtain a
   variety of important upfront information
   The *General Information* section for example determines the
   post-processor name, machine type, kinematics configuration, units
   and positioning.
   Use the *Comments* section to record revision change information
   and other important notes about the post-processor.
   The *Display Format* section is concerned with the layout of the
   operator listing file created by GENER while post-processing.
   The *Registers* section determines the format of the word addresses
   supported by your control. This section should be answered early on,
   since many questions derive their default answers based on the
   availability and format of specific word addresses.
   The *G/M Code Assignments* section defines the (G) and (M) code
   word addresses.
   The *Output Format* section determines some important information
   about the format of the NC program codes that will be
   created by GENER.

   \

-  The **Machine Description** chapter has sections that define the
   particulars about each of the machine’s axes (e.g., sign of the axis,
   velocity, travel limitations, offsets).
   The *Home Position and Reference Point* section defines information about the primary home
   point and how GOHOME and FROM commands are processed.
   The *Feedrate* section defines how interpolation velocity is controlled.
   The *Tool Change* and *Spindle* sections (not present for contouring machines)
   define the capabilities of the tool change device and those of the
   milling and turning spindles.

   \

-  The **Control Description** chapter is mostly concerned with the
   various interpolation types and motion related advanced features that
   are supported by the controller.
   The *Coordinate System* section defines the plane selection codes (e.g.,
   G17-19), in addition to translation, rotation, scaling and mirror (LCS)
   capabilities of the control.
   The *Rapid Positioning*, *Linear Interpolation* and
   *Circular and Helical Interpolation* sections define the particulars
   of these three main interpolation types.
   For turret punch presses, an additional *Punch Code Assignments* section
   defines punching and nibbling codes.
   The *Tool and Fixture Compensation* section defines
   tool length, tool radius, 3D tool and fixture compensation
   capabilities and codes.
   The *Advanced 5D Machining* section defines
   linearization, path planning, rotary turnaround (RTA),
   tool-tip programming (RTCP) and Cartesian-to-polar (C2P) features available
   for machines with continuous rotary axes.
   The *Spline Interpolation*, *Pattern Interpolation* (for punch presses) and
   *High Speed Machining* sections will only be available if you are licensed
   to use these advanced options.

   \

-  The **Automated Canned Cycles** chapter is only present for lathes
   and for mills with a Z axis. It has a *General Drill Cycle
   Information* section and a *Drill Cycles* section that handle the
   requirements for single-point cycles such as drilling, tapping,
   boring et cetera. Answer the *General Drill Cycle* section first,
   since answers in this section have an effect on the *Drill Cycles*
   section. The *Thread Cycles* section handles single-pass and
   multi-pass threading cycles available on many lathe controllers.

   \

-  The **Optional Post-processor Words** chapter has sections that deal
   with various features of the machine and controller. They are
   organized by their related ISO 4343:2000 standard post-processor
   command name. For example, the *COOLNT Command* section has questions
   dealing with various types of coolant, which are controlled in the
   post-processor using a COOLNT command.

   \

-  The **Post-Processor Customization** chapter is designed to handle
   machine and controller requirements that are not supported in any of
   the other sections. Note that in most cases, customizing a post-processor
   requires a knowledge of the ICAM macro programming language. This
   section starts with a set of *Startup/Shutdown Procedures* that can
   be used at key points in the program (for example, start of program
   or tool change) to handle special or repetitive requirements. A *Tape
   Editor* section can be used to define a series of find/replace
   strings, which will be applied to the MCD as it is written.
   The *Dialog Editor* section can be used to define dialog boxes that can
   be used by your post-processor, through macros, to prompt the NC
   programmer for input while GENER is running.
   The *User Defined Syntax Macros* section allows you to create new
   post-processor commands to control features of your machine not covered
   by Icam Post.
   The *User Function Macros* section allows you to create your own macro
   functions that can be called by other macros in the post-processor.
   Finally, a *File Storage* section is available to store
   data that can be read by the macro processor.
   See :ref:`“Post-Processor Customization”<quest_customization>` for more details.

   \

-  The **Code Table** section is a reference table listing the codes
   that have been defined in all questions asking for a G or M code. The
   code is listed as it will appear in the MCD along with: its code
   identifier, the register and value(s) that identify the code, and a
   description if available. If a code has associated registers, they
   are listed below the code. Double-click on a code or register to go
   directly to the question where that code or register was defined.
   Click on a column header to sort the list using the selected column.

The *General Description / Registers* section contains a “Use default
resolution/minimum/maximum values” checkbox that when selected will
inhibit the resolution, minimum and maximum value questions that
typically immediately follow each register definition. When checked,
the resolution and minimum responses will be set to the smallest
value that can be represented by the register; the maximum response
will be set to the largest value that can be represented by the
register. The checkbox is enabled by default on new
post-processors. The checkbox setting is saved with the post-processor
when exporting, saving or generating.

New and even experienced users sometimes have trouble finding a
question that relates to a feature of the control or machine they are
trying to define or modify. Before trying to customize a post-processor,
we strongly recommend that you first use the
**Tools»Finder** menu-bar selection (Ctrl Shift F shortcut) to find
questions related to the feature (see :ref:`here<finder_tab>`).

Saving and Generating your work
-------------------------------

Changes made to a post-processor occur in the in-memory copy. To
preserve your work, you have to either Save or Generate the
post-processor to the post-processor database (see :ref:`icamdb`
for details on the database). Save your
work periodically when performing extensive or time consuming
changes, since your changes will be lost if a power failure or system
hang-up occurs.

The **File»Save** menu-bar selection saves a copy of the
post-processor exactly as-is. Use this to save your work on an
interim or periodic basis.

The **File»Generate** menu-bar selection first checks the
post-processor for inconsistencies, then marks all questions as
answered and finally creates post-processor documentation for
record-keeping purposes, before saving the post-processor to the database.
Generated post-processors can be used by GENER in a production
setting. A QUEST listing will be created while generating, which
contains the responses, macro source and other data that comprises
the post-processor. The listing is written to the same directory as
the post-processor database, or to the directory specified by the
*icam_lis* environment variable if set.

Two types of errors can be detected during the consistency checking:
invalid or missing responses to questions in a particular section;
and inconsistent responses to questions in different sections.

-  The first type of error occurs when a section or question is
   encountered that has not been answered and for which defaults
   responses are not available (i.e., stopper questions). This type of
   error will cause the Generate function to abort after creating the
   post-processor documentation but before saving to the database (i.e.,
   a new post-processor **will not** be generated). As each error is
   detected, a message will appear in the documentation at the point of
   error and a similar message will be shown in the Build information
   window.
   Double-click on the error message (in the Build window), or
   right-mouse on the error and select “Go to Error/Tag”, to correct
   the question in error.

   \

-  The second type of error occurs when an answer to a particular
   question is inconsistent with answers to one or more other questions
   in other sections. This type of error (warning actually) will not
   cause the Generate function to abort (i.e., a new post-processor
   **will** be generated). As each inconsistency is detected, the
   problem is registered, grouped together with related problems and
   displayed in both the Build information window and the
   documentation. Double-click on the indented consistency warning (in
   the Build window) to correct what QUEST believes is the root or
   source of the problem. Double-click on outdented consistency warnings
   to correct the result or target of the problem.
   The most common warning
   is when two or more functions of the post-processor have been answered
   using the exact same MCD, as shown in the example below:

      ::

         Conflicting codes:
            M6 (code_tool_load)
            M6 (code_tool_load_manual)

   Double-click on the consistency warning in the Build window to modify
   the related question if necessary.

Regenerate once all problems have been corrected. It is not an error
to have post-processors with inconsistencies.

Testing your Post-Processor
---------------------------------

The **Tools»Start Runtime** menu-bar selection (F9 shortcut) provides
a convenient method of running GENER against any of the
post-processors currently being edited. When testing the post-processor
in this manner, it is not necessary to generate or even
save the post-processor before starting GENER. The standard GENER
launch panel will appear (see :ref:`“The Launch Panel”<launch_panel>`).
When it does, the default database will show “QUEST --
(Posts
in Memory)” and the post-processor name drop-down selection will list those
post-processors out for editing that can generate without errors.

Any changes made to your post-processor after selecting the
Tools»Start Runtime menu-bar item, but before pressing OK on the
GENER launch panel, will be respected. Changes made after GENER
starts processing will not be respected. The GENER interface supports
a restart capability. Any post-processor changes made prior to
restarting will be respected once GENER restarts.

.. note::

   Because the test feature does not require a saved or
   generated post-processor, you might be tempted to go long periods of
   time before saving or generating. You are cautioned to save your work
   periodically to minimize loss of data caused by power failures or
   other serious problems.

In addition, a **Tools»Test** menu-bar selection (F10 shortcut) provides
a simple interface to test your post-processor. First drag & drop a test
CL file onto the dialog, or use the […] browse button to locate a file,
or type or paste sample CL into the window. Then press the Test button.
An output window will appear, as shown below, tracing the input CL data
and generated MCD (i.e., NC program) along with any diagnostic messages.

.. image:: ../../media/quest_test.png
   :width: 4.500in
   :align: center

\

Hovering the mouse pointer over the generated MCD will produce a tool-tip
identifying codes and registers as well as the commands that caused them
to be generated. A right-mouse context menu will list the register or code
if applicable, and if selected will cause QUEST to open the questionnaire
section and set focus on the question that defined the selected register or code.

The **Tools»Retest** menu-bar selection (Shift F10 shortcut) can be used to
quickly test a post-processor using the last specified CL data and test settings.

Modifying an Existing Post-Processor
------------------------------------------

The **File»Open…** menu-bar selection can be used to open a
post-processor that has been previously saved or generated. You can
also open a post-processor by selecting it from the Database Navigator (more on
that in the next section). When opened, it is copied into a
new or unused Navigator tab. Use the Navigator to select the sections
you need to modify.

The **Tools»Finder** menu-bar selection (Ctrl Shift F shortcut) can
help you find pertinent questions or a list of changes you have made
to the post-processor. Matching results are shown in the lower right
Finder information window (see :ref:`here<finder_tab>`).

The **Tools»Diffs** menu-bar selection (Ctrl I shortcut) can be used
to compare the post-processor you are editing against another
post-processor or control emulator in memory or in the current or a
selected database. The difference output appears in the lower right
Diffs information window (see :ref:`here<diffs_tab>`).

The **File»Listing** menu-bar selection produces post-processor
documentation, which you may find useful for locating where changes
are necessary. The listing is written to the same directory as the
ICAM database, or to the directory specified by the *icam_lis*
environment variable if set.

A **Modification Wizard** toolbar shortcut can be selected to make
the most common types of changes using window’s controls, instead of
through the standard question-list approach.

Wrapping Up
-----------

When you close a post-processor (**File»Close** or **File»Close
All**), it is removed from the Navigator window. You will be prompted
to save your work if you attempt to close an unsaved post-processor,
or if you attempt to exit QUEST (**File»Exit**) before saving all
opened post-processors.

If one of the post-processors being edited is stuck on a stopper
question, you will receive the message “You must provide a response
to this question” when you attempt to close the post-processor or
exit QUEST. The stopper condition must be corrected, or the section
containing the stopper question must be canceled (using the Cancel
button), before you can proceed.

   When exiting, you will be prompted (as shown at right) for
   the startup configuration to use the next time you run QUEST. You can
   choose to restart with a new post-processor
   ready for creation, or to resume
   with the post-processors, control emulators and models currently open
   for editing, or to start with an empty session. If this prompt is
   disabled, you can re-enable it and/or change the restart settings
   from the “General” tab of the **Tools»Preferences** menu-bar selection.

.. [#] You may find it more convenient to create a new post-processor using the
   **File»New Post Wizard** menu-bar selection, which guides you
   step-by-step through the creation of your post-processor.

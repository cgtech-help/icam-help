Database Upgrade Procedure
==========================

Skip this section if you do not have an earlier version of Icam Post
on your system.

The following steps must be taken to upgrade post-processors from an
existing V25.1 or earlier database to the new V26 database prior to
editing them. Follow the steps below carefully for a successful
upgrade.

1. Start QUEST and select **Database»Open Database** from the menu bar
   to browse for and open the version V25.1 or earlier database. You can
   open a QUEST 2000/13 or later database created on any computer
   system, but you can only open a V12 and earlier database by running
   QUEST on the same Windows or UNIX computer type that the database was
   created on.

   \

2. The database you just selected and opened will now appear in the
   database navigator. Click on the database name to set the focus and
   then select **Database»Upgrade…** from the menu bar. You can also
   right click on the database to access the Upgrade function from a
   context sensitive pop-up window. If the Upgrade option is grayed out
   (i.e., is not selectable), this means that the database is already in
   the latest format and it does not have to be upgraded.

   \

3. After selecting the Upgrade option, you will be prompted for the name
   of the new database. By default, QUEST will suggest that the new
   database be named campost.dbf and that it be created in the *work*
   subdirectory of the ICAM application data directory (see :ref:`“Application Data Directory”
   <application_data_directory>`). If a non-empty database by that name already
   exists in the *work* subdirectory, then QUEST will suggest instead
   that the upgraded database be created in the same directory as the
   original and have the same name with _260 appended. Attempting to
   upgrade to an existing database will overwrite the contents of the
   target database (you will be asked for confirmation before
   proceeding).

   \

4. When the upgrade completes, the new V26 database will be listed
   along with the old one in the database navigator. You can remove the
   old database from the navigator window by first selecting the old
   database and then selecting **Database»Close** from the menu bar.
   This only removes the database from the navigator window, it does not
   delete or otherwise change the database itself.

   \

5. When the target database of the upgrade is not campost.dbf in the
   *work* subdirectory, you may want to subsequently copy the contents
   of the newly upgraded database there. You can merge the contents of
   an upgraded database with that of another V26 database by first
   selecting the newly upgraded database, then selecting **Database»Copy
   to database…** from the menu bar. You will be prompted to browse for
   the target database, which must be one already created using V26.

   \

6. You are advised to run a series of tests against each upgraded
   post-processor to ensure that problems have not been introduced by
   upgrading to the new release.

Note that upgrading the database is only necessary if you intend on
making changes to post-processors using QUEST. Icam Post GENER V26 is quite
capable of directly accessing a V25.1 or earlier database.

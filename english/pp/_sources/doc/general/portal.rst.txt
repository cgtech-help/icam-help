Use the right-mouse and select “Use minimized interface” to
change the portal display so that it occupies less space on the
desktop. While minimized, the large selectable tiles in the Products,
Tools, Documents, Job Progress and Licenses sections are all
replaced by small icons. Also, while minimized, you can further
resize the portal as required. Use the right-mouse and select
“Restore normal interface” to return to the original layout.

If the portal is closed, it can still be accessed from the Windows
tray bar. Select “Open” to make the portal visible on the desktop.
Various ICAM products and utilities can be started from the tray-bar
portal, including file explorer access to a directory containing all
documentation. Select “Exit” to close the portal process
completely. Job progress icons will appear in the task-bar when the
portal is not running.

On the portal main interface, click the top left caption icon on the title bar
to show the system menu, which includes an option to close the application instead of
minimizing it to the tray bar.

About Icam Post
=======================

Icam Post is a post-processor generator designed for end users with no
software programming expertise. It can accommodate a wide variety of
CNC machine types having up to six axes of continuous path control.

Icam Post allows you to create and update post-processors quickly and
easily. Its built-in Wizard and menu-driven questionnaire make it
easy for anyone to create usable post-processors.

Icam Post has a powerful, yet easy to use macro language that allows
you to completely customize your NC post-processor to support unusual
CNC control and machine tool features.

Types of Machines Supported
---------------------------

Icam Post’s Motion Processor is perhaps what most significantly
differentiates it from previous generations of post-processors. To
address the inconsistencies inherent in traditional NC
post-processors, a state-of-the-art Inverse Kinematics motion processor
was implemented. All machine tools, present and in the foreseeable
future, are mechanical subsets of this tested and proven mathematical
model.

-  Primary linear axes ( X Y Z )

-  Secondary co-linear axes ( U V W )

-  Head rotary axes to orient the tool ( A B C )

-  Table rotary axes to orient the workpiece ( A' B' C' )

-  Any Extending axis or quill ( E )

-  Any exchangeable head including nutating ( N N' )

In addition to the high level of consistency, Icam Post’s motion
processor further presents the user with advanced capabilities to
automatically support new and diverse types of machine tools:

-  Milling machines and machining centers (5 axes and up — all
   combinations of linear and rotary axes)

-  Lathes (2 and 4 axes) and merging lathes (4 axes), with optional
   sub-spindle

-  Mill-Turn centers (XZC), with additional Y axis, rotary heads and/or
   tables, merging turrets, and optional sub-spindle

-  Lasers, flame cutters and profilers

-  Wire EDM (2 to 6 axes) and punch presses (2 and 3 axes)

-  Robots (6 revolute axes)

-  Composite or Hybrid machining centers, which can combine the
   capabilities of multiple machining technologies and are supported by
   combining the capabilities of multiple post-processors

Furthermore, since Icam Post is based on a machine model that is aware
of the state of the machine tool at every moment, intelligent
decisions can be made to ensure that Machinable Data Output is
produced, rather than just controller-correct data.

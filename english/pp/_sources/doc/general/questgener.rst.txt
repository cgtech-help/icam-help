About QUEST and GENER
=====================

Icam Post consists of two parts: QUEST and GENER.

-  **QUEST** is an interactive program used to build post-processor
   files that are stored within a database. Each file contains
   information entered about a specific numerically controlled (NC)
   machine and control.

   \

-  **GENER** uses this database, along with the CL files generated by
   the CAM software, to produce the final NC control tapes for each
   specific machine.

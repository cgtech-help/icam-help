The Macro Language
==================

The ICAM macro language is used for the customization of
post-processors, as well as for the customization of control
emulators and Virtual Machine models. When a post-processor is
running in tandem with a Virtual Machine model, the post-processor
macro environment is shared with the model macro environment. Care
must be taken to avoid conflicts in variable usage between macros of
these different components. CERUN does not run within the same
environment as GENER, so conflicts between control emulator and
post-processor macros are not an issue.

Macros allow the post-processor to manipulate the records from an
input CL file to alter the sequence of CL records that are processed.
Macros can construct new CL records for processing, or suppress or
modify CL records found in the input CL file. Macro features also
exist to reposition the input CL file record pointer and to read and
write to external files (and much more).

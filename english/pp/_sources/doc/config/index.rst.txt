Configuration
*************

This chapter describes how to tailor Icam Post software to suit the needs of your specific
installation. It may be of interest to those wanting to understand how the software can be
configured or to those with CAM systems that do not appear in the standard list of interface kits.
Others can refer to this chapter to learn how to change the default choice of file types or
directories, or how to display the software in different languages. These are just a few of
the many items that can be configured.

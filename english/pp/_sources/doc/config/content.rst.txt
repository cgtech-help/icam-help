Installation Content
====================

Installation directory
----------------------

The installation root directory contains a number of small executable
files:

-  The executable files are simple generically named wrappers (i.e.,
   **config.exe**, **gener.exe**, **portal.exe**, **quest.exe**) that in
   turn execute the appropriate program stored in the **bin**
   subdirectory tree.

-  An **icamid.exe** utility can be run to get the computer’s ICAM
   system ID for licensing purposes.

The following subdirectories are located in the installation
directory:

-  The **basic** subdirectory contains basic post-processors. Basic
   post-processors are used to simplify QUEST post-processor development
   by supplying intelligent defaults for the most common machine types
   and controls. The basic subdirectory is not used by GENER.

-  The **bin/win32** and **bin/win64** subdirectories contain 32-bit and
   64-bit system dependent binary, data and executable files. These
   system dependent subdirectories include a **lang** subdirectory
   containing files related to the different languages supported by the
   product.

-  The **documentation** subdirectory contains ICAM product User Guides.
   This directory can be accessed from the software using the
   Help»Documentation menu selection.

-  The **images** subdirectory contains images used by QUEST.

-  The **integration** subdirectory contains the software and components
   necessary to
   to integrate Icam Post to a variety of CAM systems and
   extract CAM system manufacturing data for use within a Virtual
   Machine simulation.

-  The **kit** subdirectory contains
   all of the supported CAM interface
   information, organized in subdirectories below it, where each
   subdirectory name identifies a different CAM interface. Kits simplify
   the process of fine-tuning Icam Post to work in tandem with specific
   CAM systems.

.. _application_data_directory:

Application Data Directory
--------------------------

A portion of the ICAM installation is written to an ICAM\\260
subdirectory in the user’s roaming application data or common
ProgramData directory. This ICAM application data directory holds
various configuration files:

-  An **ICAM.DEF** file contains all configuration settings. This file
   must be present.

-  A **dwords.dat** file contains default Major and Minor keywords.

-  An **icam.key** file contains licensing server connection information.

The following subdirectories are located in the application data directory:

-  The **cache** subdirectory contains cached files used by Virtual
   Machine to reduce the time it takes to reload a job. This directory
   and/or its contents can be deleted at any time.

-  The **kit** subdirectory contains any customized interface
   kits. Icam Post will look for a matching interface kit, first in the
   application data kit subdirectory and then in the installation kit
   subdirectory.

-  The **macros** subdirectory contains user macro functions that can be
   shared by multiple post-processors, control emulators and models.

-  The **samples** subdirectory contains various samples that may be of
   interest. These include examples of milling, mill-turn and robotic
   manufacturing processes, an example of automatic generation of shop
   documentation, a library of Virtual Machine models, and some examples
   of external macros for developers.

-  The **work** subdirectory contains one or more database files
   containing post-processors, control emulators and virtual machine
   models. The icam_dbf environment variable must be used if the
   database is placed elsewhere or if it has a custom name.

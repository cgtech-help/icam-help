Error File
==========

The **pos260.err** file contains a list of all numbered diagnostic
messages that can be output by the post-processor. One such file is available for
each language and can be found in the “C:\\Program Files\\ICAM\\V26\\bin\\\ *system*\\lang”
installation sub-directory.

Each diagnostic message consists of 3 fields, in the form:

   :boldmono:`\\ number severity message`

-  The *number* field must not be modified because this is the number
   that GENER uses to find a particular diagnostic. However, you can
   prefix a – (minus sign) to the number to disable the output of the
   diagnostic message.

-  The *severity* field specifies the severity of the diagnostic. A
   severity from 0 through 3 signifies a message; warnings are from
   severity 4 through 7; errors from 8 through 15; and fatal errors from
   16 through 99.

-  The *message* field specifies the text associated with the diagnostic
   number. The message text does not have a length limitation. Long
   messages will be wrapped over multiple lines in the GENER listing
   file.

Lines starting with an ! (exclamation point) are a comment. Lines
starting with a \\ (backslash) define a diagnostic message.
Diagnostic message definitions can be continued from one line to the
next. All excess spacing will be ignored. The backslash character can
also be used as the last character of the message text to indicate a
space must not be added when concatenating the next continued line of
message text.

A typical message appears as follows:

   .. code-block:: text

         \ 01003004 4 MULTAX/ON with no Y-axis on this lathe.
                      Tool orientation may not be satisfied.

The following steps are necessary to customize GENER diagnostic
messages:

1. Copy an appropriate pos260.err file to your icam_appdata directory
   and give the new file a unique name. (e.g.,
   C:\\ProgramData\\ICAM\\260\\custom.err).

2. Edit the new file and change diagnostic message text and/or severity
   as required. Do not edit message numbers, except to prefix a – to
   disable the diagnostic. Add your own custom diagnostics if required.

3. To enable upwards compatibility with future installed releases,
   delete all diagnostic messages that were not modified or added.
   Ideally, this custom file should only contain modified and new
   diagnostics.

4. Run the Configuration utility (see :ref:`“The ICAM
   Configuration Utility”<configuration_utility>`); select the Gener tab; then
   edit the “Error file name” field and enter the custom diagnostic file
   name (e.g., custom.err).

Once these steps are done, GENER will use the messages defined in the
selected custom diagnostic file in place of the default ones. Changes
made to custom diagnostics will be reflected in the post-processor output the
next time GENER is run.

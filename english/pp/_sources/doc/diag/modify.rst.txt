Modifying Diagnostic Messages
=============================

Several methods are available to modify diagnostic message behavior and output.

-  The :ref:`ERROR macro command<macro_command_error>` can be used to output a diagnostic message
   given a particular diagnostic number.

   \

-  The :ref:`PPFUN/1 command<command_ppfun_1>` allows the user to set the minimum severity level
   at which to start displaying diagnostic messages in the verification listing file.
   By default, all diagnostic messages are output to the verification listing.

   \

-  The :ref:`PPFUN/2 command<command_ppfun_2>` is used to specify the threshold at which NC tape
   generation should be discontinued. By default, tape output is
   discontinued when a diagnostic with severity level 16 or higher is encountered.

   \

-  The :ref:`PPFUN/3 command<command_ppfun_3>` can be used to output a custom diagnostic message
   using the standard GENER format.

   \

-  The :ref:`PPFUN/14 command<command_ppfun_14>` is used to output a standard GENER diagnostic
   message. The diagnostic message is referenced by its number.

   \

-  The :ref:`PPFUN/15 command<command_ppfun_15>` has two distinctive uses. It can be used to
   disable and enable specific diagnostic messages. It is also used to
   redefine the severity level of specific diagnostic messages.

   \

-  The :ref:`$ERRMSG macro system variable<var_errmsg>` can be used to completely disable
   diagnostic messages.

   \

-  The :ref:`$FERSEV macro function<func_fersev>` can be used to get or set the diagnostic
   severity associated with a particular diagnostic number.

   \

-  The :ref:`$FERSTA macro function<func_fersta>` can be used to get or set the diagnostic
   enabled/disabled state associated with a particular diagnostic number.

The above facilities are run-time options to alter diagnostic message
handling for a particular job. The pos260.err file provided with the
Icam Post installation can be used as a starting point (see :ref:`next section<error_file>`)
to permanently alter standard diagnostic message severity
and/or text, or add new diagnostic messages.

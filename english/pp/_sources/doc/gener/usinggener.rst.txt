Using GENER
===========

The Icam Post post-processor tape generator “GENER” provides the
capability to post-process a center line data file (called CLDATA or
CL for short), which has been created by a CAM system. GENER does not
require that the MACHIN/*name,n* statement specifying the
post-processor name be present in the CL file. Instead, the desired
post-processor can be selected at the start of GENER processing via a
command line option or Launch Panel selection.

When coupled with ICAM’s *Virtual Machine* product, GENER can also
simulate the motions of the CNC machine’s axes, while testing for
over-travel conditions and collisions between the various machine,
tool, part and fixture components. When coupled with ICAM’s Material
Removal Simulation product, GENER can simulate the cutting actions of
the tool on the stock and also include the in-process stock when
testing for collisions.

GENER has a “full interface” mode that provides the following:

-  A Diagnostic window that lists all diagnostic messages (see :ref:`“Diagnostics”<gener_diagnostics>`).

-  Tracing windows that show the flow of processing of GENER by listing
   events as they occur (see :ref:`“Tracing”<gener_tracing>`).

-  Simulation windows to view the machine model and material removal
   simulation, as well as to view or change tool and workpiece
   compensation amounts (see :ref:`“Simulation”<gener_simulation>`).

-  Debugging windows that aid the Icam Post developer to better
   understand the relationship between CL data, macro processing and
   resultant NC program data. It does this by tracing the processing of
   various types of data and also by providing the capabilities of a
   fully functional debugger (see :ref:`“Debugging”<gener_debugging>`).

-  Menu bar functions, keyboard shortcuts and associated toolbar buttons
   to access the many features of GENER (see :ref:`“Menus”<gener_menus>`).

When GENER is run in full interface mode, post-processing starts in a
paused state. The **Run»Play** or **Run»Fast** menu selections or
toolbar buttons can be pressed to start post-processing. Once the
program is started, it will run to completion, unless interrupted by
a **Run»Pause** menu selection, or a debugging breakpoint, or by
clicking with the left-mouse in a tracing window, or by a user dialog
requesting additional information. Choose one of the Run menu
selections to again continue processing after a pause. Select
**File»Exit** when you are finished.

The simulation can be viewed from one or more Virtual Machine
windows, which are activated by a **Simulation»Virtual Machine** menu
selection. You use a combination of keyboard and mouse functions to
pan, zoom and rotate about the simulation windows (see :ref:`“Simulation»Virtual Machine”<sim_vm>`).
A companion Controller window, activated by a **Simulation»Controller** menu selection,
provides functions to move machine axes, define fixture and tool compensation amounts,
as well as replay the simulation forwards and backwards through time
(see :ref:`“Simulation»Controller”<sim_controller>`). A Manager window, activated by a
**Simulation»Manager** menu selection, provides a tree control that
permits viewing and modification of tooling, parts, fixtures and
setups (see :ref:`“Simulation»Manager”<sim_manager>`).

.. _gener_diagnostics:

Diagnostics
-----------

Diagnostic messages can be reviewed in the Diagnostics Window,
activated by a **View**\ **»Diagnostic** menu selection. Diagnostics
are recorded whether the window is activated or not. A Synchronize
function is available for the Diagnostic window, using the
right-mouse context sensitive pop-up menu. Synchronizing on a
diagnostic will cause the simulation, trace and source windows to
identify the corresponding point they were at when the diagnostic was
output.

Diagnostic messages are also output to the Console trace window but
only when activated by a **View»Console** menu selection. Diagnostic
messages are also written to the listing verification file and as
well to the log file if one was requested in the launch panel
“Options” settings. Once the program has completed, you can view a
summary of diagnostics in the verification listing using the
**File»View Listing File** menu function.

A count of diagnostics will appear in the Status bar at the bottom of
the GENER full interface window. Status bar visibility can be toggled
using the **View»Status Bar** menu selection.

.. _gener_tracing:

Tracing
-------

There are four trace windows that trace (i.e., list) various types of
input and output records. GENER provides **Run»Step** and
**Run»Pause** commands to pause processing whenever something is
written to one of these windows. The trace windows are:

   | **View»Input** traces CL file as it is read
   | **View»Output** traces NC program data (MCD) as it is written
   | **View»Console** traces diagnostics, operator messages and other console I/O
   | **View»Macro** traces macro commands as they are processed

You can single-step the post-processor by clicking with the
left-mouse button in any trace window. This produces the same effect
as setting the focus on the trace window and selecting the Run»Step
menu function. Processing will continue until the next line is output
to the selected trace window.

For dual-channel merging lathes,
the trace windows will have buttons on the title-bar labeled “0:Main” and “1:Side”,
that cause traced output to be shown only for the selected channels.
A right-mouse pop-up menu “Split View” selection toggles between side-by-side vs.
sequential tracing of information.

A Synchronize function is available for the trace windows, using the
right-mouse pop-up menu. Synchronizing on a line of output in one
trace window will cause the other trace windows as well as the source
and simulation windows to identify the corresponding point they were
at when the selected line was output. The up and down arrows can be
used to change the line of output being synchronized.

Tracing windows will continue to record information when minimized,
which may speed up processing since the screen does not have to be
updated as frequently. Tracing information will not be recorded to
any trace window that has been closed, which may significantly speed
up processing.

The maximum number of lines remembered in each of the trace windows
can be set from the Tools»Preferences»Trace menu function. When “Save
for review” is enabled, these limits are ignored on the Input, Output and
Console windows, so that the complete program can be reviewed.

More information on the View menu selection options can be found in
:ref:`“View Menu”<view_menu>`.

.. _gener_simulation:

Simulation
----------

There are three windows that are used to view and control the Virtual
Machine model and/or material removal process. These windows will
only be available if machine simulation and/or material removal
simulation were selected when GENER was started (see :ref:`“VM Tab”<vm_tab>`).

The simulation windows are:

   | **Simulation»Virtual Machine** views the model, fixtures and parts
   | **Simulation»Controller** views/modifies compensation and other controller features
   | **Simulation»Manager** views/modifies tooling, parts, fixtures and setups

The Virtual Machine window is where you view the actions of the
machine when running with a Virtual Machine model. Up to four
independent viewing windows are supported. If material removal
simulation is active, then the in-process stock will be displayed
within the machine model environment and collision detection will
include the in-process stock as one of the components to be checked
against the tool and any other collision enabled objects that can
move with respect to the stock.

This same Virtual Machine window is used when running Material
Removal Simulation without a Virtual Machine model. In this case,
only the tooling, stock, part and fixture components are drawn (i.e.,
the machine is not shown). Collision detection checks tool vs. part,
tool vs. in-process stock and tool vs. fixtures. All motions are
viewed from the perspective of the part (e.g., a table rotation will
appear as the tool arcing through space).

All of the physical components of the simulation will be
automatically setup on entry when running with a Manufacturing
Extractor (see :ref:`“Starting GENER from an Extractor”<starting_gener_from_extractor>`). These include parts
(design parts and their in-process stock), fixtures, as well as tools
and their holders. The manufacturing extractors also have the ability
to set tool compensation amounts to their nominal values and to
automatically define appropriate offsets for workpiece compensation.
Some extractors can determine multiple setup requirements as defined
by supporting CAM systems. All of these settings can be reviewed or
modified from the Simulation menu as follows:

   | **Simulation»Parts/Fixtures** defines parts (design/stock) and holding fixtures
   | **Simulation»Tools/Holders/Heads** defines cutting tools and holders; selects active head
   | **Simulation»Controller** defines tool and fixture compensation amounts
   | **Simulation»Manager** defines setups; views/modifies all of the above

The parts and fixtures define the various components that are
attached to the Stock Axis of the model. The tools and their holders
define the various components that are attached to the Tool Axis of
the model. Fixture (workpiece) compensation is generally required to
ensure the correct relationship between parts/fixtures and machine
model. Tool compensation is also generally required to ensure the
correct relationship between tools and parts. Additional setups
(beyond the initial) can be defined to account for NC machine
operator changes to the manufacturing environment during processing
(e.g., relocation of clamps).

More information on the Simulation menu selection options can be
found in :ref:`“Simulation Menu”<simulation_menu>`.

.. _gener_debugging:

Debugging
---------

There are three debugging windows that can be used to perform more
advanced Visual debugging and testing of a post-processor. The
debugging windows are:

   | **Debug»Source** lists CL and macro source.
   | **Debug»Variables** enables viewing and setting of macro variables.
   | **Debug»Stack** shows the current CL record and all active macros.
   | **Debug»Kinematics** shows the current kinematics status information

At the start of the program, the Source window shows the CL data file
to be processed. This window is updated whenever processing is paused
to show the current CL record or macro line being processed.

The Variables window shows the macro variables
that are currently in use by the program.
Variables can be viewed and modified if necessary from this window.

The Stack window shows the nesting of CL, subprograms and macros.

The Kinematics window shows the current status of all components of
the Kinematics chain used by GENER to transform input cldata
coordinates to final machine coordinates.

GENER provides **Debug»Step Over**, **Debug»Step Into** and
**Debug»Step Out** menu commands and keyboard shortcuts to single
step through CL and macros. **Debug»Run to Cursor** steps to the
selected CL record or macro line. Finally, **Debug»Jump to Cursor**
sets the selected CL record as the next one to process.

GENER provides a **Debug» Breakpoint Manager** menu function as well
as **Debug»Set/ Clear Breakpoint**, **Debug»Enable/Disable Breakpoint**
and **Debug»Remove All Breakpoints** menu functions and keyboard
shortcuts to set or clear stopping points in macros and CL.
Finally, GENER provides a **Debug»Macro Manager** menu function to
individually enable or disable macros for testing purposes.

GENER also provides **Run»Play**, **Run»Pause** and **Run»Step** menu
commands and keyboard shortcuts to start, pause and step processing.
A **Run»Fast** menu command starts processing, bringing up a progress
bar instead of the full interface, for faster execution.

More information on the Run and Debug menu selection options can be
found in :ref:`“Run Menu”<run_menu>` and :ref:`“Debug Menu”<debug_menu>`.

.. _gener_menus:

Menus
-----

The GENER full interface provides a wide variety of controls from the
menu bar. The following menus are available:

.. toctree::

   uirmenus/file
   uirmenus/run
   uirmenus/view
   uirmenus/debug
   uirmenus/simulation
   uirmenus/tools
   uirmenus/window
   uirmenus/help

For those menu functions that have keyboard shortcuts, the key
combination will be listed to the right of the menu entry. Some of
the more common functions are also available via tool bars, which can
be setup using the Tools»Toolbar menu function.

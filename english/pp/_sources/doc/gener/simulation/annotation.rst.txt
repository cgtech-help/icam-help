The Simulation»Annotation menu selections and corresponding
VM Annotation toolbar buttons provide the capability to first
(optionally) mark-up the simulation window and then take snapshots
and/or videos of the simulation.

The following functions are available.

   The **Annotate, Color** and **Clear** selections provide a
   rudimentary method of superimposing freehand drawings over the
   simulation window. When in annotation mode, the cursor will appear as
   a small pencil that will draw in the simulation window when the
   left-mouse button is held down. Drawing is equivalent to marking a
   glass pane that appears on top of the simulation window.

   The **Snapshot** selection takes a PNG image of the simulation
   window, including annotation data if present. Picture files are
   stored in the folder identified by the
   :ref:`vm_picture_dir<def_vm_picture_dir>`
   configuration (i.e., DEF file) variable. If this variable is not defined or is
   blank, then pictures are stored in the user’s “Pictures\\ICAM\\260”
   folder. Picture files are named “pic\ *nnn*.png”, where *nnn* is a
   number automatically chosen to avoid overwriting an existing picture.

   .. image:: ../../../media/vm_annotation_record_button.png
      :height: 0.219in

   The **Record** selection enables or disables the recording of the
   contents of the simulation window, including annotation data if
   present. Video files are stored in the folder identified by the
   :ref:`vm_video_dir<def_vm_video_dir>`
   configuration (i.e., DEF file) variable.
   If this variable is not defined or is blank, then videos are stored in the
   user’s “Videos\\ICAM\\260” folder. Videos are named
   “video\ *nnn*.avi” where *nnn* is a number automatically chosen to
   avoid overwriting an existing video. Recording options can be set by
   selecting the Video button in the Simulation»Options dialog Misc tab.

   The **Open** selection provides quick and easy access to the user’s
   pictures and videos folders.

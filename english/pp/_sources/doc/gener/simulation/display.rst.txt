Simulation»Display (Ctrl Alt D)
-------------------------------

Activates the Display dialog, which is used to change the HUD “heads-up”
display settings. The heads-up display is a small status screen that
floats above the simulation window. The position, content and appearance
of the heads-up display are controlled from the Display dialog.

Individual layout schemes can be saved in the Windows
Registry by selecting Save As and entering a name. Changes to the
currently listed scheme (in the *Scheme* drop-down) are saved when OK is
pressed. A scheme can be removed from the registry by selecting the name
in the scheme drop-down and then selecting Delete. The “Default” scheme
cannot be changed or deleted.

Select the *Show Display* checkbox to activate the heads-up display in the
simulation window (Ctrl D does the same when the Display dialog is not
active). Select the “*Use default schemes in cycle*” checkbox to include
the Default display when using Ctrl D to cycle through each of the
schemes in sequence. The following status information can appear in the
heads-up display.

-  **Tool number**: The current tool ID or tool pocket number.

-  **Machine axis**: The linear and rotary axes controlled by GENER.

-  **Feedrate**: The current feed interpolation rate or the keyword RAPID.

-  **Motion type**: A keyword describing the type of motion, e.g., LINEAR, CIRCULAR.

-  **Active compensations**: Fixture, length and diameter compensation settings.

-  **Coolant**: The current coolant status.

-  **Spindle**: The current spindle status and rpm.

-  **Time**: Elapsed machining time.

-  **Channels**: Current active channel and time.

-  **Head number**: The current head ID or head pocket number.

-  **Operation name**: The current operation name if defined in the program.

-  **Extra spindles**: Additional information about spindles.

-  **Extra channels**: Additional information about channels.

-  **Extra axes**: Additional axes in the model.

-  **FPS**: The simulation window display rate in the form “*a* / *b*”. The
   value “*a*” is the redraw speed in frames/second and is an indicator of
   graphic performance. The value “*b*” is actual screen updates/second
   and is an indicator of total model performance.

The *Position* input field specifies in which corner the heads-up display
will appear. The text appearance is controlled by the *Font, Size,
Bold, Italic* and *Text Color* input fields. The heads-up display will
appear directly over the simulation window contents. You can experiment
with various frame background colors (*BG Color*) and vary the background
opacity (*BG Opacity*) to obtain the best contrast.

Simulation Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Simulation menu is only available if Material Removal Simulation
and/or Virtual Machine Simulation were selected in the Simulation
launch panel settings (see :ref:`“VM Tab”<vm_tab>`). More
details on the Simulation menu functions can be found in the
*“Virtual Machine Users Guide”*. The following simulation menu
functions are available:

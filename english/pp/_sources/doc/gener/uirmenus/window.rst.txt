   This menu selection is used to restore up to five
   different windows layouts, previously saved using the **Windows»Save
   Layout** menu function described immediately below. Layouts can
   also be instantly recalled by selecting one of the corresponding five layout recall toolbar buttons.

**Window»Save Layout**

   This menu selection is used to save up to five different windows
   layouts. Once you have organized the GENER windows in a way that you
   would like to remember for future purposes, select the “Save Layout”
   menu selection and choose one of the 5 listed layouts. Layout
   information is stored in the Windows Registry so it can be remembered
   from one GENER session to the next.

**Window»Default Layout**

   This menu selection resets the layout to a built-in default.

**Window»Style**

   This menu selection can be used to choose from amongst a selection of
   built-in window colorization styles.

**File»New Job** (Ctrl N)

   Stops processing and returns to the launch panel where new
   options or an entirely different program can be specified.

**File»Save for review**

   Saves the current processing state, trace, simulation and
   diagnostic window contents, and all associated files into a
   compressed archive file, with file extension *zrj*, suitable for
   later viewing. To view a zrj file, either load the file using the JOB
   button or drop the file onto the launch panel or desktop icon.
   Explicitly saving the process inhibits the automatic save that
   normally occurs at the end of processing when the “save for review”
   launch panel preference is selected.

**File»View Listing File**

   Once processing has completed, the post-processor listing can be
   viewed by selecting this menu selection or its related toolbar
   button, or by selecting the “View Listing” button on the progress
   dialog. The WordPad editor will be used to view the file if there is
   no application associated with the GENER listing file type.

**File»View Tape File**

   Once post-processing has completed, the main NC program file can be
   viewed by selecting this menu selection or its related toolbar
   button. The WordPad editor will be used to view the file if there is
   no application associated with the GENER tape file type.

**File»Exit** (Alt F4)

   Stops processing and exits GENER.

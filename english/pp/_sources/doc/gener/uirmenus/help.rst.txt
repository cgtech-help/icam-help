**Help»Customer ID…**

   This menu selection lists your customer ID, also called a PRISER
   (primary serial number). This unique identification is required when
   making technical support requests.

| **Help»Check for Update…**
| **Help»Update Available…**

   The **Check for Update** menu selection contacts an ICAM server on
   the Internet to determine if there is a more recent release of the
   software available for download. If so, a [Download…] button will be
   available. Updates come in two forms: official updates periodically
   made available to all customers, and hotfix updates made available to
   specific customers to solve a reported problem.

   Selecting the download button will download an installation
   executable file with the name
   icam\_\ *version*-*modlev*\ \_win\ *nn*.exe. To install the update,
   follow the :ref:`“Installing from download link”<install_download>` instructions.

   Updates are automatically checked once per day unless disabled by
   clearing the “Check for update” box on the dialog. If updates are
   available, the menu selection changes to **Update Available**.

**Help»About**

   This menu selection lists the version and mod-level (modification
   level). This information is also available at the top of the GENER
   listing. It is generally helpful to include the version and mod-level
   in any technical support request.

The amount and types of information traced to the Input, Output,
Console and Macro windows can be set using the
Tools»Preferences»Trace menu function as well as from the launch
panel Output dialog (see :ref:`here<options_dialog>`).

**View»Input**

   This toggle activates or disables the input
   CL file trace window. When active, CL records
   will be listed in the Input window as they are read.
   Right-mouse in the Input window and select Options to bring up the
   following Tools»Preferences»Trace settings that affect Input tracing:

   -  **Original input file source lines:** If selected, CL file records
      will be shown in their original input format whenever possible. By
      default, GENER traces CL file data in an ICAM standard format. This
      setting only has an effect when a record is first read. Records that
      are re-read following a look-ahead or CL file repositioning, will
      always be shown in their standard format.
   -  **Look-ahead processing, curve fitting and the $FGET search:** If
      selected, tracing will also be enabled during all forms of
      look-ahead. Select this only when debugging macros that use the
      look-ahead features of GENER.

The last 20,000 input trace lines are remembered unless changed via
the Tools»Preferences»Trace settings. The Output, Console and Macro
trace windows (described below) are similarly limited.

**View»Output**

   This toggle activates or disables the
   output NC program file trace window.
   When active, NC program data will be listed in the Output window as it is written.

   The **Run»Details** toggle affects tracing and stepping in the Output
   window. When selected, tracing and stepping occurs as individual
   registers are placed in the output NC program buffer.

   Hovering the cursor over the output trace will show a tooltip
   containing the following contextual information: the code or register
   type, the post-processor command name that caused the code or
   register data to be output, and the current ISN and CL record numbers
   at the moment the code or register was output. The appearance of
   contextual help tooltips in the output trace is controlled from the
   Tools»Preferences»Debug “\ **Enable output trace context
   information**\ ” checkbox.

**View»Console**

   This toggle activates or disables the console trace window.
   When active, operator messages, diagnostic messages and macro processor
   I/O will be listed in the Console window.
   Right-mouse in the Console window and select Options to bring up the
   following Tools»Preferences»Trace settings that affect Console tracing:

   -  **Operator and other** **message:** traces operator
      messages (DISPLY command).
   -  **Macro IO commands:** traces macro processor file I/O (OPEN, READ,
      WRITE and CLOSE commands).
   -  **Diagnostics:** traces diagnostic messages with the specified and
      higher severity.

**View»Macro**

   This toggle activates or disables the Macro trace window. When active,
   macro commands will be listed in the Macro window as they are processed.
   The Macro trace window also identifies when macros are activated and completed.
   The formatting of macro code can be controlled from the Tools»Preferences»Debug
   “\ **Macro format**\ ” selection.

**View»Controller**

   This toggle shows or hides the Controller window. This window
   includes a **Codes** tab pane that lists active modal G and M codes,
   and a **PPFUN** tab pane that lists the current state of the various
   PPFUN commands. When running with Virtual Machine, the controller
   window has additional tab panes to view and modify model related
   data.

**View»Diagnostic**

   This toggle shows or hides the Diagnostic window. This window records
   all diagnostic messages output since the start of processing,
   regardless of whether or not the window was visible or not.

   The diagnostic window provides “filter” toggle buttons that can be
   used to hide/show errors, warnings and informational messages. A
   right-mouse pop-up window provides access to additional
   functionality, as follows:

   -  **Synchronize** simulation, trace and source windows to the selected
      diagnostic.
   -  **Mark as reviewed** marks individual diagnostics as reviewed, as an
      aid to a systematic review of the program. Various options permit
      marking of similar diagnostics. Diagnostics can also be marked
      reviewed by selecting them and checking the Reviewed box.
   -  **Hide reviewed** toggle shows or hides all diagnostics marked as
      reviewed.
   -  **Clear reviewed** clears the “reviewed” state of all diagnostics.
      The reviewed state of diagnostics can also be cleared by selecting
      them and clearing the Reviewed box.
   -  **Clear sorting** causes diagnostics to be listed in the order they
      were originally output. Clicking on a diagnostic column header causes
      diagnostics to be sorted in increasing or decreasing order by that
      column’s information.
   -  **Column** settings indicate the type of information to be listed.
   -  **Copy selection** to the paste buffer.

   Diagnostic window settings are remembered with other user preferences
   in the Windows Registry.

**View»Loading Sequence**

   This brings back the Loading dialog that normally appears while the
   software is initializing and that then disappears once processing is
   ready to start. This dialog lists the various initialization actions
   and the elapsed time taken for each. Indentation is used to break
   down multiple steps of an initialization process. The Loading dialog
   must be closed before continuing processing. The appearance of the
   Loading dialog at the start of processing can be controlled from the
   “\ **Loading/ Processing Detail**\ ” selection in the
   Tools»Preferences»General settings.

| **View»Increase X Margin** (Ctrl Left)
| **View»Decrease X Margin** (Ctrl Right)

   These change the width of the left hand field that lists axes names
   in the Controller»Axes tab.

**View»Status bar**

   This toggle enables the display of the status bar. The status bar
   lists various information about the progress of the post-processor,
   including: count of diagnostics,
   CL and ISN numbers, machining time, NC program length
   and a progress bar.
